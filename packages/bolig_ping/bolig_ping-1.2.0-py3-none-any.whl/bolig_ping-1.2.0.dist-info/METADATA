## Quickstart

The easiest way to use the package is as a
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) tool. You can simply start
searching for flats using the following command:

```bash
uvx bolig_ping --city københavn
```

This both installs the package and runs the command. All the available options are
listed below, but you can always get these by running the following command:

```bash
uvx bolig_ping --help
```


To be able to send emails, you have to create a [Google app
password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), and store both your Gmail email
address and the app password in the environment variables `GMAIL_EMAIL` and
`GMAIL_PASSWORD`, respectively. You can also simply store these in a `.env` file, as
follows:

```bash
GMAIL_EMAIL=<your-email>@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=<your-app-password>
```

With this set up, you can now use the `--email` option to receive an email with new
flats that match your search criteria:

```bash
uvx bolig_ping --city københavn --email <your-email>
```

You can also set up a recurring search if you have a server available. In this case, you
can add the following line to your [crontab](https://linuxhandbook.com/crontab/) on a
server, to run the search every hour:

```bash
0 * * * * uvx bolig_ping <search-arguments>
```


## All options

The following options are available:

- `--city/-c` (required): The city you want to search in. This argument can be
  used several times to search in multiple cities, e.g., `-c aarhus -c odense`.
- `--min-price`: The minimum price of the flat, in DKK. Default is no minimum price.
- `--max-price`: The maximum price of the flat, in DKK. Default is no maximum price.
- `--min-rooms`: The minimum number of rooms in the flat. Default is no minimum number
  of rooms.
- `--max-rooms`: The maximum number of rooms in the flat. Default is no maximum number
  of rooms.
- `--min-size`: The minimum size of the flat, in square meters. Default is no minimum
  size.
- `--max-size`: The maximum size of the flat, in square meters. Default is no maximum
  size.
- `--email`: The email address you want to receive the ping on. Note that this needs to
  have the `GMAIL_EMAIL` and `GMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variables set, as described
  above. Default is to use no email address, and instead print the flats to the
  console.
