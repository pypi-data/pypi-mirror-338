# Finalsa Async Models

Finalsa Async Models is a Python library designed to simplify the implementation of asynchronous data models. It provides tools to handle asynchronous operations, making it easier to work with modern Python applications that rely on async/await patterns.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Data Models**: Define and manage data models with full async support.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified API for seamless integration into your projects.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend and customize models to fit your needs.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-performance asynchronous workflows.

## Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install finalsa-async-models
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Finalsa Async Models:

```python
from finalsa_async_models import AsyncModel

class User(AsyncModel):
    async def save(self):
        # Custom save logic
        pass

# Example usage
async def main():
    user = User()
    await user.save()
```
