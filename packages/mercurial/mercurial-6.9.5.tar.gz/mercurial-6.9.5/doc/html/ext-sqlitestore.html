<p>store repository data in SQLite (EXPERIMENTAL)</p>
<div class="section" id="description">

<p>The sqlitestore extension enables the storage of repository data in SQLite.</p>
<p>This extension is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. There are NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
GUARANTEES. This means that repositories created with this extension may
only be usable with the exact version of this extension/Mercurial that was
used. The extension attempts to enforce this in order to prevent repository
corruption.</p>
<p>In addition, several features are not yet supported or have known bugs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Only some data is stored in SQLite. Changeset, manifest, and other repository
data is not yet stored in SQLite.</li>
<li>Transactions are not robust. If the process is aborted at the right time
during transaction close/rollback, the repository could be in an inconsistent
state. This problem will diminish once all repository data is tracked by
SQLite.</li>
<li>Bundle repositories do not work (the ability to use e.g.
<cite>hg -R &lt;bundle-file&gt; log</cite> to automatically overlay a bundle on top of the
existing repository).</li>
<li>Various other features don't work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This extension should work for basic clone/pull, update, and commit workflows.
Some history rewriting operations may fail due to lack of support for bundle
repositories.</p>
<p>To use, activate the extension and set the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">storage.new-repo-backend</span></tt> config
option to <tt class="docutils literal">sqlite</tt> to enable new repositories to use SQLite for storage.</p>
