# Robot Hat

This is a Python library for controlling hardware peripherals commonly used in robotics. This library provides APIs for controlling **motors**, **servos**, **ultrasonic sensors**, **analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)**, and more, with a focus on extensibility, ease of use, and modern Python practices.

The motivation comes from dissatisfaction with the code quality, safety, and unnecessary `sudo` requirements found in many mainstream libraries provided by well-known robotics suppliers, such as [Sunfounder's Robot-HAT](https://github.com/sunfounder/robot-hat/tree/v2.0) or [Freenove's Pidog](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Robot_Dog_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi). That being said, this library was originally written as a replacement for Sunfounder's Robot-HAT.

Unlike the aforementioned libraries:

- This library scales well for **both small and large robotics projects**. For example, advanced usage is demonstrated in the [Picar-X Racer](https://github.com/KarimAziev/picar-x-racer) project.
- It offers type safety and portability.
- It avoids requiring **sudo calls** or introducing unnecessary system dependencies, focusing instead on clean, self-contained operations.

## Installation

Install this via `pip` or your favorite package manager:

```bash
pip install robot-hat
```

## Usage Examples

### Motor Control

Control dual motors using the `MotorService` modules.

```python
from robot_hat import MotorConfig, MotorService, MotorFabric

left_motor, right_motor = MotorFabric.create_motor_pair(
    MotorConfig(
        dir_pin="D4",
        pwm_pin="P12",
        name="LeftMotor",
    ),
    MotorConfig(
        dir_pin="D5",
        pwm_pin="P13",
        name="RightMotor",
    ),
)
motor_service = MotorService(left_motor=left_motor, right_motor=right_motor)

# move forward
speed = 40
motor_service.move(speed, 1)

# move backward
motor_service.move(speed, -1)

# stop
motor_service.stop_all()

```

### Controlling a Servo Motor with ServoCalibrationMode

The `ServoCalibrationMode` is an enum used to define how the calibration offsets are applied to the servo's angle. It supports two predefined modes and also allows for custom calibration functions for advanced use cases.

#### Available Modes

1. **SUM**: Adds a constant offset (`calibration_offset`) to the input angle. This is generally used for steering operations, like managing front wheels in a robotics car.
   - Formula:
     \( \text{calibrated_angle} = \text{input_angle} + \text{calibration_offset} \)
2. **NEGATIVE**: Subtracts the constant offset after inverting the input angle. This mode may be helpful for servos that require an inverted adjustment, like a camera tilt mechanism.
   - Formula:
     \( \text{calibrated_angle} = -1 \times (\text{input_angle} + (-1 \times \text{calibration_offset})) \)

#### Configuring the `ServoService`

The `ServoService` provides a high-level abstraction for managing servo operations. It allows for easy configuration of the calibration mode, constraints for the servo's movement bounds, and custom calibration logic if needed.

Here's how to use `ServoCalibrationMode` in your servo configuration:

##### Example 1: Steering Servo Using `ServoCalibrationMode.SUM`

For steering purposes (e.g., controlling front wheels of a robotics car):

```python
from robot_hat import ServoCalibrationMode, ServoService

steering_servo = ServoService(
    servo_pin="P2",
    min_angle=-30,  # Maximum left turn
    max_angle=30,   # Maximum right turn
    calibration_mode=ServoCalibrationMode.SUM,  # Adds offset directly
    calibration_offset=-14.4,  # Adjust servo position for centered alignment
)

# Turn left
steering_servo.set_angle(-30)

# Turn slightly right
steering_servo.set_angle(15)

# Center position
steering_servo.reset()
```

##### Example 2: Head Servos Using `ServoCalibrationMode.NEGATIVE`

For tilting a camera head (e.g., up-and-down movement):

```python
from robot_hat import ServoCalibrationMode, ServoService

cam_tilt_servo = ServoService(
    servo_pin="P1",
    min_angle=-35,  # Maximum downward tilt
    max_angle=65,   # Maximum upward tilt
    calibration_mode=ServoCalibrationMode.NEGATIVE,  # Inverted adjustment
    calibration_offset=1.4,  # Adjust alignment for neutral center
)

# Tilt down
cam_tilt_servo.set_angle(-20)

# Tilt up
cam_tilt_servo.set_angle(25)

# Center position
cam_tilt_servo.reset()
```

---

#### Custom Calibration Mode

If the predefined modes (`SUM` or `NEGATIVE`) donâ€™t meet your requirements, you can provide a custom calibration function. The function should accept the `angle` and `calibration_offset` as inputs and return the calibrated angle.

Example:

```python
def custom_calibration_function(angle: float, offset: float) -> float:
    # Example: Scale angle by 2 and add offset to fine-tune servo position
    return (angle * 2) + offset

servo = ServoService(
    servo_pin="P3",
    calibration_mode=custom_calibration_function,
    calibration_offset=5.0,
    min_angle=-35,
    max_angle=65,
)
servo.set_angle(10)  # Custom logic will process the input angle
```

### I2C Example

Scan and communicate with connected I2C devices.

```python
from robot_hat.i2c import I2C

# Initialize I2C connection
i2c_device = I2C(address=[0x15, 0x17], bus=1)

# Write a byte to the device
i2c_device.write(0x01)

# Read data from the device
data = i2c_device.read(5)
print("I2C Data Read:", data)

# Scan for connected devices
devices = i2c_device.scan()
print("I2C Devices Detected:", devices)
```

### Ultrasonic Sensor for Distance Measurement

Measure distance using the `HC-SR04` ultrasonic sensor module.

```python
from robot_hat.pin import Pin
from robot_hat.ultrasonic import Ultrasonic

# Initialize Ultrasonic Sensor
trig_pin = Pin("P9")
echo_pin = Pin("P10")
ultrasonic = Ultrasonic(trig_pin, echo_pin)

# Measure distance
distance_cm = ultrasonic.read(times=5)
print(f"Distance: {distance_cm} cm")
```

### Reading Battery Voltage

Use the ADC module to measure and scale the battery voltage.

```python
from robot_hat.battery import Battery

# Initialize Battery module
battery = Battery(channel="A4")

# Get battery voltage
voltage = battery.get_battery_voltage()
print(f"Battery Voltage: {voltage} V")
```

## Comparison with Other Libraries

### No sudo

For reasons that remain a mystery (and a source of endless frustration), the providers of many popular DRY robotics libraries insist on requiring `sudo` for the most basic operations. For example:

```python
User = os.popen('echo ${SUDO_USER:-$LOGNAME}').readline().strip()
UserHome = os.popen('getent passwd %s | cut -d: -f 6' % User).readline().strip()
config_file = '%s/.config/robot-hat/robot-hat.conf' % UserHome
```

And later, they modify file permissions with commands like:

```python
os.popen('sudo chmod %s %s' % (mode, file_path))  # ðŸ¤¦
os.popen('sudo chown -R %s:%s %s' % (owner, owner, some_path))
```

This library removes all such archaic and potentially unsafe patterns by leveraging user-friendly Python APIs like `pathlib`. File-related operations are scoped to user-accessible directories (e.g., `~/.config`) rather than requiring administrative access
via `sudo`.

### Type Hints

This version prioritizes:

- **Type hints** for better developer experience.
- Modular, maintainable, and well-documented code.

### Mock Support for Testing

`Sunfounder` (and similar libraries) offer no direct way to mock their hardware APIs, making it nearly impossible to write meaningful unit tests on non-Raspberry Pi platforms.

```python
import os
os.environ["GPIOZERO_PIN_FACTORY"] = "mock"
os.environ["PYGAME_HIDE_SUPPORT_PROMPT"] = "1"
```

## Distribution

To create distributable artifacts (e.g., `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files):

1. Install the build tool:

   ```bash
   pip install build
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
   The built files will be located in the `dist/` directory:

- Source distribution: `robot_hat-x.y.z.tar.gz`
- Wheel: `robot_hat-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`

These can be installed locally for testing or uploaded to PyPI for distribution.

---

## Common Commands

- **Clean Build Artifacts**:
  ```bash
  rm -rf build dist *.egg-info
  ```
- **Deactivate Virtual Environment**:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

---

## Notes & Recommendations

- The library uses `setuptools_scm` for versioning, which dynamically determines the version based on Git tags. Use proper semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`) in your repository for best results.
- Development tools like `black` (code formatter) and `isort` (import sorter) are automatically installed with `[dev]` dependencies.
