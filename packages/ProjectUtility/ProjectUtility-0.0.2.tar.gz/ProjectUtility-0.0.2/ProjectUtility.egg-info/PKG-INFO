# Project Utility


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

> This project is a collection of essential functions and utilities that
> I frequently use in my data analysis workflows.

## Why This Project Exists

As a data analyst, I found myself repeatedly writing the same helper
functions across different projects. ProjectUtility centralizes these
common utilities into a single, well-documented package that can be
easily imported into any analysis.

### Install ProjectUtility in Development mode

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

``` sh
# make sure ProjectUtility package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to ProjectUtility
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/mtinti/ProjectUtility):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/mtinti/ProjectUtility.git
```

or from [conda](https://anaconda.org/mtinti/ProjectUtility)

``` sh
$ conda install -c mtinti ProjectUtility
```

or from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ProjectUtility/)

``` sh
$ pip install ProjectUtility
```
