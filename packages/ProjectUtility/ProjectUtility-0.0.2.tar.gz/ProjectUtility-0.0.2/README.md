## Why This Project Exists

As a data analyst, I found myself repeatedly writing the same helper
functions across different projects. ProjectUtility centralizes these
common utilities into a single, well-documented package that can be
easily imported into any analysis.

### Install ProjectUtility in Development mode

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

``` sh
# make sure ProjectUtility package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to ProjectUtility
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/mtinti/ProjectUtility):
