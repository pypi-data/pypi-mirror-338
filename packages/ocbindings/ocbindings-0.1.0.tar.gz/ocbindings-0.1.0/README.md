# OpenConfig bindings

This repo is set up to pull from https://github.com/openconfig/public and
generate python bindings for all available models using pyangbind.

The primary value of this repository is to provide a packaged, pip installable
asset, since pyangbind generates a lot of bloat that is unwieldy to generate
for one off scripts or check in to repos.
