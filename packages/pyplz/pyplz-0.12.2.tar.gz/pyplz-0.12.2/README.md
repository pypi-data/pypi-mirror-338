## Why use a task runner?
A task runner automates tasks like building, testing, and deploying, making them
faster and more reliable. It ensures consistent execution and simplifies collaboration
 by providing clear, reusable commands.

## Why `pyplz`?

`pyplz` aims to be a friction-free task runner. While many task runners simplify development, they can also add friction with unfamiliar syntax, extra tools, or difficult integrations.

üêç **Python-first**: Leverage familiar Python syntax‚Äîif you know Python, you know `pyplz`.  

ü§ó **Author-friendly**: Intuitive and ready to use out of the box, with built-in support for development & debugging.  

üíª **CLI-compliant**: Enjoy a command-line interface that adheres to GNU and POSIX conventions, ensuring a seamless terminal experience.

üîó **Integration-ready**: Whether you're running Python locally, in containers, or in a CI/CD pipeline, `pyplz` fits seamlessly into your environment.  

üìö **Documented**: Access extensive documentation and automatically generated task-specific help, ensuring you always have the information you need.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Using python 3.9 or later, run `pip install pyplz`
2. Create a `plzfile.py` in the root of your project
3. Using your terminal, execute `plz` in the root of your project

!!! tip "Development Dependencies"
    For best practice, include development dependencies (e.g., `pytest`) in a dedicated file (such as `requirements.dev.txt`). Add `pyplz` to your dev dependencies to ensure it's available out of the box for every project contributor.

### Quick Start

Create your first task by making a `plzfile.py` in your project root:

```python
from pyplz import plz

@plz.task()
def test():
    """Test the project."""
    plz.run("pytest")
```

To add options for test unit tests only (e.g., without integration tests), or adding test coverage, update your task as follows:

```python
from pyplz import plz

@plz.task()
def test(unit_only: bool = False, coverage: bool = False):
    """Test the project."""
    marks = "-m unit" if unit_only else ""
    cov = "--cov" if coverage else ""
    plz.run(f"pytest {marks} {cov}")
```

You can view task-specific help with:
```bash
‚ùØ plz test -h
usage: plz [-h] [--unit-only] [--coverage]

Test the project.

system options:
  -h, --help   Show this help message and exit.

optional arguments:
  --unit-only  Set unit_only to True (bool, default: false)
  --coverage   Set coverage to True (bool, default: false)
```

Now, your `test` task can continue to evolve, without needing some special documentation in a separate file, or a slack message to update your team members!
