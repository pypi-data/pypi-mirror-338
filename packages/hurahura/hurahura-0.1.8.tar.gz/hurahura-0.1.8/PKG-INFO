# hurahura - formerly miresearch

Organisation and automation tools for medical imaging research data

__hurahura__ is maori for "to investigate" or "to look around"

## Installation: 

```bash
pip install hurahura
# formerly: pip install imaging-research

```

## About

This is a collection of classes for following OOP principles for organisation of research data for medical imaging research studies. 

The intention is to provide a framework that will store imaging data on a "per __examination__" basis in a structured format. This structured format then permits simple interrogation, and automation.  

It takes advantage of the dicom standard and the package [spydcmtk](https://github.com/fraser29/spydcmtk) for automating and generalising many typical steps with the intention of making the researcher's life easier. 

This package may be easily adapted and expanded upon for a high level control over your research data. Or, it may be used as is for basic structure and organisation of data and automation of common tasks. 


## Class structure

**AbstractSubject**  class is top level class taking inputs:
- *subjectNumber* : an integer
- *dataRoot* : the root directory where subjects to be stored             
- *subjectPrefix* : a prefix to be combined with *subjectNumber* for naming each subject
    - Optional: will be guessed from subjects already present in *dataRoot* if not given. 
- *DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_TREE* : DirectoryStructureTree class to define directory structure for each subject directory (see wiki for construction shortcuts)
    - Optional: Defaults to **RAW** and **META** directories. 

This is the basic parent class containing fundamental methods for organisation and management. See  [hurahura docs](https://fraser29.github.io/hurahura/) for advanced usage, epsecially via inheritance and polymorphism. 

# Exposed commandline tool: miresearch

```bash

hurahura -h
usage: hurahura [-h] [-config CONFIGFILE] [-FORCE] [-QUIET] [-INFO] [-DEBUG] [-s [SUBJNLIST ...]] [-sA] [-sf SUBJNLISTFILE] [-sR SUBJRANGE SUBJRANGE] [-y DATAROOT] [-sPrefix SUBJPREFIX] [-sSuffix SUBJSUFFIX] [-anonName ANONNAME]
                [-Load LOADPATH] [-LOAD_MULTI] [-LOAD_MULTI_FORCE] [-RunPost] [-SubjInfo] [-SubjInfoFull] [-SummaryCSV [SUMMARYCSV ...]] [-Summary] [-WatchDirectory WATCHDIRECTORY] [-qSeriesDesc QSERIESDESC] [-qPID QPID]
                [-qPatName QPATNAME] [-qExamID QEXAMID] [-qDate QDATE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Management Parameters:
  -config CONFIGFILE    Path to configuration file to use.
  -FORCE                force action - use with caution
  -QUIET                Suppress progress bars and logging to terminal
  -INFO                 Provide setup (configuration) info and exit.
  -DEBUG                Run in DEBUG mode (save intermediate steps, increase log output)

Subject Definition:
  -s [SUBJNLIST ...]    Subject number(s)
  -sA                   All subjects
  -sf SUBJNLISTFILE     Subject numbers in file
  -sR SUBJRANGE SUBJRANGE
                        Subject range
  -y DATAROOT           Path of root data directory (where subjects are stored) [default None -> may be set in config file]
  -sPrefix SUBJPREFIX   Subject prefix [default None -> will get from config file OR dataRoot]
  -sSuffix SUBJSUFFIX   Subject suffix [default ""]
  -anonName ANONNAME    Set to anonymise newly loaded subject. Set to true to use for WatchDirectory. [default None]

Actions:
  -Load LOADPATH        Path to load dicoms from (file / directory / tar / tar.gz / zip)
  -LOAD_MULTI           Combine with "Load": Load new subject for each subdirectory under loadPath
  -LOAD_MULTI_FORCE     Combine with "Load": Force to ignore studyUIDs and load new ID per subdirectory
  -RunPost              Run post load pipeline
  -SubjInfo             Print info for each subject
  -SubjInfoFull         Print full info for each subject
  -SummaryCSV [SUMMARYCSV ...]
                        Write summary CSV file (give output file name)
  -Summary              Print summary of provided subjects to commandline (best with -sA option)
  -WatchDirectory WATCHDIRECTORY
                        Will watch given directory for new data and load as new study

Query:
  -qSeriesDesc QSERIESDESC
                        Query based on a series description
  -qPID QPID            Query based on patient ID
  -qPatName QPATNAME    Query based on a patient name
  -qExamID QEXAMID      Query based on exam (scanner assigned) ID
  -qDate QDATE          Query based on study date


```

# Configuration

hurahura uses a miresearch.conf file for configuration. 

By default miresearch.conf files are search for in the following locations: 

1. source_code_directory/miresearch.conf (file with default settings)
2. $HOME/miresearch.conf
3. $HOME/.miresearch.conf
4. $HOME/.config/miresearch.conf
5. Full file path defined at environment variable: "MIRESEARCH_CONF"
6. Full path passed as commandline argument to `hurahura`

Files are read in the above order with each subsequent variable present overwritting any previously defined. 
For information on files found and variables used run:

`hurahura -INFO` 

## systemctl 

Running mi_watcher via systemctl is an attractive application: 

### Ubuntu instructions:

- Build a .service file in /etc/systemd/system:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My mi_watcher Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/path/to/script
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Build /path/to/script: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source /myvenv/bin/activate
hurahura -WatchDirectory /path/to/watch_directory -config /path/to/my_proj.conf
```

- Reload systemd
- enable service
- start service
  
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable myservice.service
sudo systemctl start myservice.service
```
