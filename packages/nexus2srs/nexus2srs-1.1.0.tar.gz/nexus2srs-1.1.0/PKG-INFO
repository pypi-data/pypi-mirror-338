              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# nexus2srs
Program to convert NeXus (.nxs) scan Files to the classic ASCII SRS .dat files.


By Dan Porter, *Diamond Light Source Ltd.* 2023-2025


### Usage
From Terminal:
```
$ python -m nexus2srs '12345.nxs' '12345.dat' -tiff
```

In Python script:
```Python
from nexus2srs import nxs2dat

nxs2dat('12345.nxs', '/spool', write_tiff=False)
```

At Diamond Light Source:
```bash
$ module load nexus2srs
(python 3.12) $ cd /dls/i##/data/20##/mm####-1
(python 3.12) $ nexus2srs . spool/ -sync
```
In a Linux Terminal, this starts a continuous syncronisation process.

### Requirements
**python 3.10+**,
*hdfmap*, *h5py*, *numpy*, plus *pillow* for writing TIFF images

### Installation
From PyPI:
```
$ python -m pip install nexus2srs
```

### Methodology
The file conversion follows the following protocol:
1. Open .nxs HDF file (using h5py) and create list of all datasets and groups using hdfmap
2. Generate the top part of the header, either by looking for the **'scan_header'** dataset or by populating with date, time and run number.
3. Generate the list of metadata items in the header by selecting datasets with *size <= 1*, as available:
   1. Search for datasets with attribute **@local_name**, the name saved will be the last part of this name.
   2. If no **@local_name** datasets are found, take dataset names of all *size <= 1* datasets in the file. Each dataset is saved as 'name' and 'group_name'.
4. Build table of scanned data points by selecting datasets of equal shape with *size >= 1*, as available:
   1. Get names of fields from the dataset called **'scan_fields'**, find these datasets in the first **NXdata** group or group called **'measurement'**
   2. Or, take all datasets in the default or first **NXdata** or group called **'measurement'**, with the same shape as the first dataset in this group
   3. Or, take all datasets in the file with shape equal to with the most common dataset shape in the file
5. Search for dataset **'image_data'**, generate a template from the first contained TIFF image path and add to metadata
6. Find 3D+ arrays in all **NXdetector** groups, generate and add TIFF image paths to metadata 


For metadata and the table of scanned data, if the datasets contain the **@decimals** attribute, they will be rounded accordingly. 


Once the conversion is complete, the components are joined into a single string including the header, metadata and 
table of scanned data. By default, a NeXus file at *'folder/file.nxs' will be saved as *'folder/file.dat'*. 
If TIFF writing is enabled, detector image data from 3+D arrays in all **NXdetector** groups will be saved as TIFF 
images into a sub-folder like *'folder/****RunNo***_***DetectorName****_files/00001.tif'*. Files will not be overwritten if 
they already exist.

### Command line arguments
Usage (from terminal):
```bash
$ nexus2srs 12345.nxs 12345.dat
```
Include '-tiff' in arguments to save detector images as tif images.

Single synchronisation of files (batch job):
```bash
$ nexus2srs /path/to/nxs_files /path/to/dat_files
```

Continuous synchronisation of files (starts a continuous process):
```bash
$ nexus2srs /path/to/nxs_files /path/to/dat_files -sync
```

| --quiet              | Turn off logging (except errors)                       |

### Testing (Jan 2023)

 - Testing has been performed on several thousand old I16, I10 and I21 nexus files.
 - No unexpected failures were found in these, however none of the files conform to the new, ideal nexus structure.
 - Local files are converted in ~0.3s per file without image conversion.
 - See Jupyter notebook [nexus2srs_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/nexus2srs/blob/master/examples/nexus2srs_tests.ipynb) for more information.
 - Tested with nxs2dat jupyter processor on I16 15/12/2023, updated TIFF file writing.

### Update September 2024

Significant re-factoring of code to include the [hdfmap](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/hdfmap) package.
The HdfMap function takes care of creating the scannables table and the metadata, using current NeXus best practice.
This allows for correct identification of metadata and uses "local_names" and "decimals" attributes.
