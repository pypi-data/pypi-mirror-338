Welcome to simplesat's documentation!
=====================================

A library for SAT-based dependency handling. The ``simplesat`` library
provides facilities for describing packages and their relationships, producing
a set of CNF clauses, and producing a solution for the clauses, according to
the notion of a "policy," which determines the order in which packages are
tried.
