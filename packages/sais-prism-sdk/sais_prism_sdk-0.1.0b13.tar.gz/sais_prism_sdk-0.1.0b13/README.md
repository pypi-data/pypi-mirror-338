## Unified Interface for ML Lifecycle Management

### Background
In today's data-driven AI era, model development has evolved from traditional single-model training into a complex end-to-end engineering process. As AI applications deepen in industrial scenarios, data governance in the traditional internet domain has primarily focused on storage layers such as data warehouses and data lakes. However, data governance in industrialized AI scenarios is far more intricate. Beyond managing the storage and governance of raw data, it also involves handling intermediate data generated during feature engineering, versioning of training datasets, and more. The quality of this data directly impacts model performance.

Compared to data applications in the traditional internet domain, the data pipeline in AI for Science (AI4S) scenarios is longer and more interdependent. From the collection of raw data to the training data processed through feature engineering, to the experimental data generated during model training, and finally to the deployed model files—each step produces a vast array of assets that require tracking and management. This complexity necessitates the establishment of a comprehensive data and model management system.

### Problem Statements
- [Fragmented Training](#fragmented-training) : The current machine learning (ML) training process is disjointed and lacks a unified management approach. Algorithm developers are operating in a "black box" manner, with no standardized specifications for training code, environment setup, or scenario definitions. Everyone is working independently, leading to inconsistent training standards, uncoordinated code management, and a lack of model standardization.
- [Incomplete Data and Model Lifecycle](#incomplete-data-and-model-lifecycle) : Data used in each ML process (metadata), such as file paths, versions, and specific files, is not centrally recorded and is instead scattered across individual personal directories. Similarly, training-related parameters, metrics, and statuses (including model training status and data lifecycle states like quality) associated with models are inadequately tracked, making it difficult to ensure consistency and reliability.
- [Lack of Visualized Management](#lack-of-visualized-management) : Currently, operations are command-line based, with no clear visual interface for managing models and data. Elements such as checkpoints, performance indicators, and versions from the training process cannot be effectively retrieved, shared, or served, exacerbating the management challenges.

### Architecture Design

![Architecture Diagram](img/arc.png)

### Key Design Principles

1. **Dot Notation Configuration Access** - All configuration items are accessible through dot notation (e.g., `config.ml.model_repo.name`) using SimpleNamespace implementation
2. **Model Metadata Standards** - Model metadata uses tags to record framework, task type, and other critical information
3. **Semantic Versioning** - All model versions follow the SemVer specification
4. **Unified Artifact Storage** - All outputs are consistently stored in the artifacts directory
5. **Modular Architecture** - Project follows a layered, modular design with core modules for client/models/training/deployment/utils

### Use Manual

#### Installation

```bash
pip install sais-prism-sdk
```

Current version: 0.1.0-beta9

#### Configuration (example)
The configuration file `sais_foundation.yaml` is mandatory. This file is used to configure the tool for project-level settings. If not found, the tool will throw an error.

There are three main sections in the configuration file: `foundation`, `unified_data_access`, and `ml`. The foundation is used to configure the experiment name, while the unified_data_access section is used to configure the data access settings, and the ml section is used to configure the MLflow settings.

```yaml
foundation:
  experiment_name: lifescience

unified_data_access:
  enabled: false
  token: demo_token
  data_access:
    dataset_names:
    - alpaca_sft_dataset.jsonl
    - mars
ml:
  enabled: true
  auto_log: true
  system_tracing: true
  security:
    enabled: true
    username: lifescience
    password: lifescience_~#
  parameters:
    output_dir: artifacts/runtime
    device: mps
    dataset_names:
    - /cpfs01/projects-HDD/cfff-4a8d9af84f66_HDD/public/Data/ecmwf-001/ENS
    base_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
    num_train_epochs: 3
    per_device_train_batch_size: 2
    gradient_accumulation_steps: 8
    learning_rate: 2.0e-05
    weight_decay: 0.02
    warmup_steps: 100
    save_total_limit: 1
    logging_dir: ./logs
    logging_steps: 10
    save_strategy: epoch
    evaluation_strategy: no
    report_to:
    - mlflow
    optim: adamw_torch
    gradient_checkpointing: true
  custom_metrics: []
  artifacts: []
  model_repo:
    model_uri: runs:/{run_id}/artifacts/model
    name: llama_models
    await_registration_for: 300
    tag:
      framework: pytorch
      task_type: language-model
      model_type: llama_lifescience
      base_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
    version: 1.0.1
```

#### Security Settings

The SDK supports secure authentication for MLflow through the configuration:

```yaml
ml:
  security:
    enabled: true
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
```

When security is enabled, these credentials are securely passed to MLflow for authentication.

#### System Metrics Tracing

Enable detailed system metrics collection during training:

```yaml
ml:
  system_tracing: true
```

This setting enables tracking of GPU utilization, memory consumption, and other system metrics during model training.

#### Command-line Configuration Override

The SDK supports overriding or adding configuration values directly from the command line without modifying the YAML file. This is useful for quick experimentation or when running in environments where the YAML file cannot be modified.

The configuration override follows the dot notation pattern to access nested configuration items. You can use the following formats:

```bash
# Format 1: Multiple parameters with separate --config flags
python your_script.py --config key.path=value --config another.key=value2

# Format 2: Multiple parameters with a single --config flag
python your_script.py --config key.path=value another.key=value2
```

**Examples:**

1. Override training parameters:
```bash
python examples/sft_training_example.py --config ml.parameters.warmup_steps=100 ml.parameters.weight_decay=0.02
```

2. Change experiment name:
```bash
python examples/sft_training_example.py --config foundation.experiment_name=new_experiment
```

3. Update model repository configuration:
```bash
python examples/sft_training_example.py --config ml.model_repo.name=new_model ml.model_repo.version=1.1.0
```

4. Pass a list as a value (use JSON format):
```bash
python examples/sft_training_example.py --config ml.parameters.dataset_names='["/path/dataset1", "/path/dataset2"]'
```

5. Pass a dictionary as a value:
```bash
python examples/sft_training_example.py --config ml.model_repo.tag='{"framework": "pytorch", "task_type": "classification"}'
```

By default, changes made through command-line overrides are also written back to the YAML file. If you want to apply changes only in memory without modifying the YAML file, you can modify the `parse_cli_args` function call in your script:

```python
from sais_prism.core.config import parse_cli_args

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Only apply changes in memory, don't update YAML file
    parse_cli_args(update_yaml=False)
    
    # Run your code
    YourClass().run()
```

This feature provides flexibility for experimentation and CI/CD pipelines, allowing you to easily override configuration values without modifying the YAML file directly.

### Framework Integration

SAIS Prism seamlessly integrates with popular ML frameworks:

1. **PyTorch Lightning** - Full callback support for training lifecycle events
2. **Transformers** - Native integration with Hugging Face Transformers training loop
3. **General PyTorch** - Support for standard PyTorch training workflows

## Model Evaluation

After training your SFT model, you can evaluate its performance using our evaluation framework. The SDK provides tools to generate custom evaluation datasets and measure model performance against standardized metrics.

### Step 1: Generate Evaluation Dataset

First, create an evaluation dataset using the `generate_evaluation_dataset.py` script:

```bash
python examples/generate_evaluation_dataset.py --output examples/evaluation_dataset.jsonl
```

This script generates a JSONL file containing pharmaceutical domain test questions for evaluating your model. You can:
- Control the number of questions with `--num_questions`
- Customize the output path with `--output`
- Modify the script to add your own domain-specific questions

The evaluation dataset follows this format:
```json
{"instruction": "What are the different classifications of the drug Imatinib?", "input": "", "output": "Expected detailed response about Imatinib classifications..."}
```

### Step 2: Run Model Evaluation

Evaluate your fine-tuned model against the evaluation dataset:

```bash
python examples/evaluate_sft_model.py --model_path ./fine_tuned_model --evaluation_file examples/evaluation_dataset.jsonl
```

Additional command-line options:
- `--max_samples N`: Limit the number of samples to evaluate
- `--max_new_tokens N`: Set maximum generation length (default: 200)
- `--output_file PATH`: Specify custom output file path

### Step 3: Review Evaluation Results

The evaluation script calculates performance metrics including:

1. **ROUGE scores** (measuring text overlap with reference answers):
   - ROUGE-1: Word unigram overlap
   - ROUGE-2: Word bigram overlap
   - ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence

2. **BLEU score** (measuring translation quality)

3. **Generation performance**:
   - Tokens per second
   - Generation time

Sample evaluation summary from a recent run:
```
===== EVALUATION SUMMARY =====
rouge1: 0.2845
rouge2: 0.1421
rougeL: 0.2234
bleu: 0.0857
avg_tokens_per_second: 21.98
avg_generation_time: 9.10
total_samples: 10

Detailed results saved to artifacts/sft_evaluation_results_20250226_105423.json
```

### Evaluation Artifacts and Storage

Following project standards, all evaluation artifacts are stored in the `artifacts` directory with appropriate metadata:

1. **Evaluation Results**: The JSON file containing detailed evaluation metrics is stored with proper versioning according to semver standards
   ```
   artifacts/evaluation_results/sft_evaluation_results_v1.0.1_20250226.json
   ```

2. **Model Metadata**: Each evaluation includes tags for:
   - Framework (pytorch)
   - Task type (language-model)
   - Base model
   - Evaluation dataset information

3. **MLflow Integration**: All evaluation metrics are automatically tracked in MLflow, allowing for:
   - Comparison between model versions
   - Visualization of performance trends
   - Correlation between hyperparameters and evaluation metrics
