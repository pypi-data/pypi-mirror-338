Imatinib is also used to treat other types of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and some cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 5. Imatinib is a targeted therapy, meaning it specifically targets the cancer cells, rather than the body as a whole. 6. Imatinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, meaning it is more effective than the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 7.

      "input": "",
      "prediction": "Metformin is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its mechanism of action:\n\n1. **Inhibition of AMPK**: Metformin binds to and inhibits the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key enzyme involved in cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is activated in response to low energy levels, and it plays a crucial role in regulating glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\n2. **Increased glucose uptake**: By inhibiting AMPK, metformin increases the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. This is achieved through the activation of various signaling pathways that promote glucose uptake, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway.\n\n3. **Enhanced insulin sensitivity**: Metformin also increases insulin sensitivity by reducing the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as glucose transporter",
      "reference": "Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production through inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I) and activation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). This leads to reduced gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It also increases peripheral glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, reduces intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and insulin receptor expression.",
