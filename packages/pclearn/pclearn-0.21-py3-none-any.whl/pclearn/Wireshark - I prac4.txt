Use filters to analyze the packets:  

- `ip.addr == 192.168.1.106` to display packets based on a specific IP address.  
- `ip.src == 192.168.1.106` to display packets coming from a specific IP address.  
- `ip.dst == 142.250.192.14` to display packets going to a specific IP address.  
- `http` to filter packets using the HTTP protocol.  
- `http.request` to display HTTP requests.  
- `http.response.code == 200` to filter packets with successful connections.  
- `tcp.port==80 || udp.port==443` to show packets using ports 80 or 443.  
- `tcp contains facebook` to find packets containing the keyword "facebook".
