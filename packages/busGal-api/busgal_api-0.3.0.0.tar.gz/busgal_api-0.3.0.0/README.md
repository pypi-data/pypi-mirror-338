Python API wrapper for [the galician public transport](https://www.bus.gal/) which uses the
associated
[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gal.xunta.transportepublico)'s
http API to get the inforamtion about buses, your card and your user
account. I got the endpoints using [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/).

## üìú Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://peprolinbot.github.io/bus.gal-api). There are two main submodules: `busGal_api.transport` and `busGal_api.accounts`, the first one has all the functions related to transportation and the second one allows you to manage cards and accounts, as the name implies.

## üîß Installation

Just run:

``` bash
pip install busGal_api
```

## ‚úÖ Quick examples

There are quick examples for both the submodules mentioned above in their `__main__.py` and their docs.
