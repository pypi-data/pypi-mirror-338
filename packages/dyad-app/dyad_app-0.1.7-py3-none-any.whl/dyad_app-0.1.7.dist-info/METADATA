# Dyad: AI Coding Mentor & Pair Programmer

Dyad is an **open-source**, **standalone** AI tool that levels up your coding skills and helps you build real-world software. It’s more than a code generator—it’s a dedicated mentor and practical companion that runs locally, connects to your codebase, and complements—not replaces—your IDE.
