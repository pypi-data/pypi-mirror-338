        is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to

        MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources
        and tools. \\n Why MCP? \\n MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows
        on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and
        MCP provides: \\n \\n A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM
        can directly plug into \\n The flexibility to switch between LLM providers
        and vendors \\n Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
        \\n \\n General architecture \\n At its core, MCP follows a client-server
        architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers: \\n
        \\n MCP Hosts : Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want
        to access data through MCP \\n MCP Clients : Protocol clients that maintain
        1:1 connections with servers \\n MCP Servers : Lightweight programs that each
        expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
        \\n Local Data Sources : Your computer\u2019s files, databases, and services
        that MCP servers can securely access \\n Remote Services : External systems
        available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect
        to \\n \\n Get started \\n Choose the path that best fits your needs: \\n
