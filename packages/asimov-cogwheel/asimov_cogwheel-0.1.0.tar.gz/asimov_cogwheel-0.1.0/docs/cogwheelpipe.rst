Cogwheelpipe
============

Cogwheel pipe is a commandline interface to cogwheel which is provided by asimov-cogwheel.
This is required to allow asimov to deploy cogwheel jobs to a scheduling system such as htcondor,
but it also allows us to configure cogwheel using configuration files, in a similar way to other parameter estimation codes.
