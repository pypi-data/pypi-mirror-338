# unique-playgrounds-py

A helper class for working with the Unique Network blockchain. It simplifies interaction with Substrate and provides wrappers over standard extrinsics of Unique Network. 

Created similarly to the TypeScript version (https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-chain/tree/develop/js-packages/playgrounds) used for testing Unique Network releases.
