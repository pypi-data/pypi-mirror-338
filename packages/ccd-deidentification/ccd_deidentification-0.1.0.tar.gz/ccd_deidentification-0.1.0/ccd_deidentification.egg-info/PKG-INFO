# CCD Deidentification

This Python project is designed to de-identify Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs), which are XML files used in
healthcare to encode patient information.

## Features

- Masks sensitive information in various parts of the CCD, such as names, IDs, birth times, addresses, and telecom
  values.
- Uses spaCy for natural language processing to mask free-text sections.
- Consistently masks the same original text with the same masked value.
- Logs details about masked items.
- Can convert the log of masked items into a Spark DataFrame.
- Can parse a CCD XML string, de-identify sensitive info, and return modified XML.

## Dependencies

This project depends on several Python packages, including:

- lxml
- spacy
- pydantic
- jinja2
- markupsafe2

These can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

First, create an instance of `CCDDeidentifier`:

```python
from ccd_deidentification.deidentifier import CCDDeidentifier

deidentifier = CCDDeidentifier()
```

Then, you can use the `deidentify_ccd_xml` method to de-identify a CCD XML string:

```python
deidentified_xml = deidentifier.deidentify_ccd_xml(original_xml)
```

The `deidentify_ccd_xml` method returns a new XML string with sensitive information masked.

You can also use the `mask_map_to_data_frame` method to convert the log of masked items into a Spark DataFrame:

```python
df = deidentifier.mask_map_to_data_frame()
```

## Note

This project is designed for production use in Health Information Exchanges or similar environments. As with any
software that handles sensitive data, it should be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure it meets all relevant legal
and ethical standards for data handling and privacy.
