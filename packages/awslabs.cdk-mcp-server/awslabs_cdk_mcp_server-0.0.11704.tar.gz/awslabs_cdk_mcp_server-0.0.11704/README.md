## Prerequisites

1. Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
2. Install Python using `uv python install 3.13`

## Installation

Here are some ways you can work with MCP across AWS, and weâ€™ll be adding support to more products including Amazon Q Developer CLI soon: (e.g. for Amazon Q DeveloperCLI MCP, `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.cdk-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.cdk-mcp-server@latest"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

When using this MCP server, you should consider:

- Reviewing all CDK Nag warnings and errors manually
- Fixing security issues rather than suppressing them whenever possible
- Documenting clear justifications for any necessary suppressions
- Using the CheckCDKNagSuppressions tool to verify no unauthorized suppressions exist

Before applying CDK NAG Suppressions, you should consider conducting your own independent assessment to ensure that your use would comply with your own specific security and quality control practices and standards, as well as the local laws, rules, and regulations that govern you and your content.
