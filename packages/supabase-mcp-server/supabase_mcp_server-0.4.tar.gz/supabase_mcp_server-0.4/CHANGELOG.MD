## [0.3.12] - 2025-03-12
### Added
- Implemented a new `retrieve_logs` tool that allows retrieval of logs from any Supabase log collection - Postgres, PostgREST, Auth, Edge Functions and others. Provides a way to query and filter
- Implemented log rotation to prevent unbounded log file growth (5MB limit with 3 backup files)

### Changed
- Improved region configuration with clearer error messages for region mismatches
- Updated smithery.yaml to reduce configuration error rate (Tenant not found)
- Improved PostgreSQL client connection error handling with specific guidance for "Tenant or user not found" errors


## [0.3.11] - 2025-03-10
### Fixed
- Fixed an error with creating a migration file when a user doesn't have `supabase_migrations` schema


## [0.3.10] - 2025-03-09
### Added
- Enhanced migration naming system with improved object type detection for procedures, functions, and views.
- Expanded `retrieve_migrations` tool with pagination, name pattern filtering, and option to include full SQL queries.

### Changed
- Updated setup instructions for Claude Desktop
- Updated setup instructions for Cline
- Updated and fixed Smithery.ai setup

## [0.3.8] - 2025-03-07
### Added

- Enhanced API spec tool with multiple query modes and risk assessment
- Connection retry logic for database and API operations
- Code coverage with pytest-cov
- SQL linting with SQLFluff

### Changed
- Refactored to use dependency injection pattern
- Standardized service initialization to synchronous pattern
- Improved SQL safety categorization:
  - `safe`: Read-only operations (always allowed)
  - `write`: Data modification (requires unsafe mode)
  - `destructive`: Schema changes (requires unsafe mode + confirmation)
- Updated Ruff to v0.9.9
- Added asyncpg-stubs and pytest-mock for testing

## [0.3.7] - 2025-03-02
### Fixed
- Documentation inaccuracies

### Added
- Auth admin SDK support for local Supabase instances


## [0.3.6] - 2025-02-26
### Added
- Added `call_auth_admin_method` which enables MCP server to manage users in your database (create, update, delete, confirm). All Auth SDK methods are supported
- Added `get_auth_admin_methods_spec` to retrieve documentation for all available Auth Admin methods. Response objects now use attribute access (dot notation) instead of dictionary access.

### Fixed

## [0.3.5] - 2025-02-26
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with `get_tables` so that it reliably returns foreign tables and views
- Updated docs to describe how to setup mcp.json with project-specific MCPs

### Changed
- Significantly improved docs to make install, configuration, usage instructions super clear


## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-23
### Added
- Full support for read-write SQL operations:
  - Implemented safety mode system with read-only (default) and read-write modes
  - Added mode switching with automatic reset to read-only
  - Enhanced transaction support for testing write operations
  - Improved error handling for read-only violations
- Support for Supabase Management API
  - Introduces supabase management API integration with safe (enabled by default) and yolo modes
  - Includes the following tools:
    - `send_management_api_request` to send arbitrary requests to Supabase Management API, with auto-injection of project ref and safety mode control.
    - `get_management_api_spec` to get the enriched API specification with safety information
    - `get_management_api_safety_rules` to get all safety rules including blocked and unsafe operations with human-readable explanations
    - `live_dangerously` to switch to yolo mode
  - Safety features:
    - Divides API methods into `safe`, `unsafe` and `blocked` categories based on the risk of the operation
    - Allows to switch between safe and yolo modes dynamically
    - Blocked operations (delete project, delete database) are not allowed regardless of the mode
