scikit-fda: Functional Data Analysis in Python
===================================================

|python|_ |build-status| |docs| |Codecov| |repostatus| |versions| |PyPIBadge| |conda| |license| |doi|

Functional Data Analysis, or FDA, is the field of Statistics that analyses
data that depend on a continuous parameter.

This package offers classes, methods and functions to give support to FDA
in Python. Includes a wide range of utils to work with functional data, and its
representation, exploratory analysis, or preprocessing, among other tasks
such as inference, classification, regression or clustering of functional data.
See documentation for further information on the features included in the
package.

Documentation
=============

The documentation is available at
`fda.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ <https://fda.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, which
includes detailed information of the different modules, classes and methods of
the package, along with several examples showing different functionalities.

The documentation of the latest version, corresponding with the develop
version of the package, can be found at
`fda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://fda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Installation
============
Currently, *scikit-fda* is available in Python versions above 3.8, regardless of the
platform.
The stable version can be installed via PyPI_:

.. code::

    pip install scikit-fda

It is also available from conda-forge:
.. code::

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-fda

Installation from source

    pip install ./scikit-fda

Make sure that your default Python version is currently supported, or change
the python and pip commands by specifying a version, such as ``python3.8``:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/GAA-UAM/scikit-fda.git
    python3.8 -m pip install ./scikit-fda
