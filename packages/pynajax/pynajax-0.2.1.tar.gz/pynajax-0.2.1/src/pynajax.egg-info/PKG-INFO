Welcome to `pynajax`, a GPU accelerated backend for [pynapple](https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynapple) built on top on [jax](https://github.com/google/jax). It offers a fast acceleration for the core pynapple functions using GPU. 

> **Warning**
> ⚠️ This package is not meant to be used on its own. It should only be used through the pynapple API.

## Installation
Run the following `pip` command in your virtual environment.

**For macOS/Linux users:**
 ```bash
 pip install pynajax
 ```

**For Windows users:**
 ```
 python -m pip install pynajax
 ```

Alternatively, you can install pynapple and pynajax together.

```bash
 pip install pynapple[jax]
```



## Basic usage

To use pynajax, you need to change the pynapple backend using `nap.nap_config.set_backend`. See the example below : 

```python
import pynapple as nap
import numpy as np
nap.nap_config.set_backend("jax")

tsd = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(100), d=np.random.randn(100))

# This will run on GPU or CPU depending on the jax installation
tsd.convolve(np.ones(11)) 
```

## Benchmark

This benchmark for the `convolve` function was run on a GPU.

See the documentation for others benchmarks.
