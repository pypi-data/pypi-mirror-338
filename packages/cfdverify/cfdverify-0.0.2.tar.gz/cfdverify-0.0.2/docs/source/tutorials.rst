The tutorials sub-directory contains scripts to help new users learn CFDverify. There are currently five tutorial scripts containing quick examples of how to run CFDverify for solution verification analysis. Additionally, the sub-directory contains the same scripts in Jupyter notebook form (.ipynb) if you prefer to conduct your analysis in Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorials are:

#. Quick start showing basic usage
#. Input options for discretization class construction
#. Pre-defined models available for discretization class
#. Discretization class attributes and methods of interest
#. How to build a custom discretization class with pre-defined models
