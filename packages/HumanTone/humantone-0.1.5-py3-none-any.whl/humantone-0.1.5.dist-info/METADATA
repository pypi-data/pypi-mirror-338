# Humanlike Sentiment:

HumanTone is a powerful and intuitive Natural Language Processing (NLP) library designed to enhance human-like text processing and interaction. It integrates advanced sentiment analysis, intelligent text paraphrasing, semantic similarity detection, and natural speech synthesis, making it an all-in-one solution for text-based AI applications.

## Features


✅ Sentiment Analysis – Accurately determines the emotional tone of a given text (Positive, Negative, Neutral) with confidence scores.
*
✅ Paraphrasing – Generates high-quality paraphrases while maintaining semantic meaning, improving text diversity and readability.
*
✅ Text Similarity Detection – Compares sentences for semantic similarity, aiding in duplicate detection, question-answering, and recommendation systems.
*
✅ Speech Synthesis – Converts text into natural-sounding speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.

HumanTone is ideal for chatbots, content generation, virtual assistants, and AI-driven conversations, helping developers create more natural and engaging user experiences. Designed for ease of use, it ensures seamless integration into Python projects.
