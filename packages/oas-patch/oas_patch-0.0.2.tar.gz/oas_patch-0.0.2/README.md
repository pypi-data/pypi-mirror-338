# OpenAPI Specification Patcher

The OpenAPI Specification Patcher (oas-patch) is a command-line utility that allows you to programmatically modify or update OpenAPI specifications using [overlay documents](https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification) . It supports both YAML and JSON formats and provides powerful JSONPath-based targeting for updates and removals.

## Features
- **JSONPath Support**: Use JSONPath expressions to target specific parts of your OpenAPI document.
- **Flexible Updates**: Apply updates or remove elements from your OpenAPI specification.
- **YAML and JSON Support**: Works seamlessly with both YAML and JSON OpenAPI documents.
- **Sanitization**: Optionally remove special characters from your OpenAPI document.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` for managing Python packages

## Installation
### Install from Source
Clone the repository and install the tool locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oas-patch
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
The tool provides a simple CLI for applying overlays to OpenAPI documents.


### Example Usage
Apply an overlay to an OpenAPI document and save the result:
```bash
oas-patch --openapi openapi.yaml --overlay overlay.yaml --output modified_openapi.yaml
```

Apply an overlay and print the result to the console:
```bash
oas-patch --openapi openapi.json --overlay overlay.json
```

Sanitize the OpenAPI document while applying the overlay:
```bash
oas-patch --openapi openapi.yaml --overlay overlay.yaml --sanitize
```
