Advances in sensor technology have rapidly increased our ability to monitor 
natural and human-made physical systems. In many cases, it is critical to 
process the resulting large volumes of data on a regular schedule and alert 
system operators when the system has changed. Automated quality control and 
performance monitoring can allow system operators to quickly detect performance 
issues.  

Pecos is an open source Python package designed to address this need. Pecos 
includes built-in functionality to monitor performance of time series data, 
subject to a series of quality control tests. The Python package includes 
methods to run quality control tests defined by the user and generate reports 
which include performance metrics, test results, and graphics. The software was 
developed specifically for solar photovoltaic system monitoring, but is 
designed to be used for a wide range of applications.
