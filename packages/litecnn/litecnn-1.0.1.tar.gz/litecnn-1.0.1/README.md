LiteCNN is a Python library designed to simplify the creation, training, and visualization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It provides an intuitive interface for deep learning enthusiasts and developers who want to work with CNN models without the complexity often associated with neural network frameworks.


## Features

- Straightforward definition of CNN layers with intuitive syntax
- Streamlined training and model evolution capabilities
- Visual representation of model architecture
- 15 pre-configured popular Keras application models ready for immediate use
- Seamless conversion of Keras models to ONNX format

## Basic Usage/Example

```python
from easycnn.core import LiteCNN
from easycnn.visualizer import TrainingVisualizer
import os
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10

class_names = ['car', 'plane', 'cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'deer', 'horse', 'frog', 'ship', 'truck']

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

my_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'car.jpg')

x_train = x_train[:2000]
y_train = y_train[:2000]
x_test = x_test[:400]
y_test = y_test[:400]
x_train = x_train / 255
x_test = x_test / 255

model = EasyCNN()
model.add_conv(32, 3)
model.add_max_pool(2)
model.add_conv(64, 3)
model.add_max_pool(2)
model.add_conv(128, 3)
model.add_max_pool(2)
model.add_flatten()
model.add_dense(10, activation='softmax')
model.compile()
history = model.train(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, epochs=5)
prediction = model.predict(my_file)

visualizer = TrainingVisualizer()
visualizer.plot_training(history)
```
