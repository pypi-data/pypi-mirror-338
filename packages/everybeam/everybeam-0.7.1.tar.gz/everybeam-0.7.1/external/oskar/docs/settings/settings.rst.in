This document describes the settings files used by OSKAR applications, which
use the INI plain-text file format.

.. tip::

   If you are using the OSKAR GUI, the settings descriptions are
   available as tool-tips, and you should not need to refer to this document.

Settings are defined simply using key-value pairs, for example:

.. code-block:: text

   simulator/double_precision=true
   observation/start_time_utc=01-01-2000 12:01:02.000
   observation/length=06:00:00.000

Settings can also be grouped into sections. For example, the above can also be
written as:

.. code-block:: text

   [simulator]
   double_precision=true

   [observation]
   start_time_utc=01-01-2000 12:01:02.000
   length=06:00:00.000

Settings files can be written or modified using any text editor, by using the
``--set`` command line flag when running the application,
via the OSKAR Python interface, or by using the OSKAR GUI.

The following sections describe the currently available settings.
