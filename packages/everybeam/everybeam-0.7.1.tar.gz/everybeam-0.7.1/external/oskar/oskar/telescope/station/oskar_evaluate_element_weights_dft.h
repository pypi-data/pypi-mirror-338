 * @brief
 * Function to compute DFT element phase weights.
 *
 * @details
 * This function computes the DFT phase weights for each element.
 *
 * The wavelength used to compute the supplied wavenumber must be in the
 * same units as the input positions.
 *
 * @param[in] num_elements   The number of elements in the array.
 * @param[in] x              Element x positions.
 * @param[in] y              Element y positions.
 * @param[in] z              Element z positions.
 * @param[in] cable_length_error Element cable length errors.
 * @param[in] wavenumber     Wavenumber (2 pi / wavelength).
 * @param[in] x_beam         Beam x direction cosine.
 * @param[in] y_beam         Beam y direction cosine.
 * @param[in] z_beam         Beam z direction cosine.
 * @param[out] weights       Output DFT phase weights per element.
 * @param[in,out] status     Status return code.
