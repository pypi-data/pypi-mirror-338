This is a simple design to verify GEYSER's ability to work with Vivado. This design was tested with `xcku5p-ffvb676-1-e`. To utilize this design you will need to synthesize the two cores present within `compute.c`. They are compute and compute2. 

The `generate.py` is what will construct the actual design.
