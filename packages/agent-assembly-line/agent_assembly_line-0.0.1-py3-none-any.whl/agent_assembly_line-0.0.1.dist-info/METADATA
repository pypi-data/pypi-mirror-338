              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

# Agent-Assembly-Line

[Build AI agents in Python. A library for developers.](#simple-api)

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/circleci/X9bys8RB5EMsjhQjp1eEDL/JkxNCG7MxwpLaBBRHyfEXt/tree/main.svg?style=shield)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/circleci/X9bys8RB5EMsjhQjp1eEDL/JkxNCG7MxwpLaBBRHyfEXt/tree/main)

Agent-Assembly-Line is a framework for building AI agents that can be easily embedded into existing software stacks. Includes ready-to-use components for task-based and conversational agents.

Agent-Assembly-Line offers components that simplify the setup of agents and multi-agent chains and works with local and cloud based LLMs.

Agent-Assembly-Line supports:
- Task based Agents (Functional Agents)
- Conversational Agents
- Local memory
- RAG for Local documents or remote endpoints
- Websites, RSS, JSON, PDF, ..
- Local LLMs as well as cloud-based LLMs: Ollama and ChatGPT
- Streaming mode and regular runs
- Context
- Micros: small, single task agents that handle distinct functionalities and can be chained
- cli-agents: agents that can be chained on the command line

Agent-Assembly-Line comes with examples such as [Semantic Unittests](tests/llm/test_text_validator.py), [Diff Analysis](examples/diff_analysis.py), and more; a demo chat app and tests.

# Example

Create an agent for fetching the weather in Helsinki

```Python
from agent_assembly_line import FmiWeatherAgent

agent = FmiWeatherAgent("Helsinki", forecast_hours=24, mode="local")
result = agent.run()
```

Output: "The rest of today in Helsinki will be sunny and mild with temperatures around 4 degrees Celsius. Expect clear skies throughout the evening and overnight.

# Getting Started

## Install Python Environment

```console
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It works with Python 3.9.6

## Install Service

```console
cp agent-assembly-line-service.service /etc/systemd/system/agent-assembly-line.service
sudo systemctl enable agent-assembly-line.service
systemctl is-enabled agent-assembly-line.service


journalctl -u agent-assembly-line.service
```

## Tests

Run all tests:

```console
make test
```

or

```console
python -m unittest tests/test.py
```

just one test:
```console
python -m unittest tests.async.test_memory.TestMemory.test_save_messages
```

## Build and Run the Demo App

The demo app provides a UI that talks to the REST API and can handle chat-based conversations, functional agents, memory and summaries, file upload and urls.

```
cd app/
npm run electron
```

## Setup an LLM

You can use a local LLM as well as cloud-based LLMs. Currently supported are Ollama and OpenAI, more to come.

> **Note:**
> 
> Choosing between a local or cloud LLM depends on your specific needs: local LLMs offer greater control, privacy, and potentially lower costs for frequent use, while cloud LLMs provide easy scalability, access to powerful models, and reduced maintenance overhead. Consider your requirements for data security, performance, and budget when making your decision.


### Ollama

To use an Ollama LLM, use the `ollama` identifier:

```
ollama:gemma2:latest
ollama:codegemma:latest
```

Make sure you have Ollama installed on your machine:

[Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

Then run it once on your console, it will download your model:

```console
ollama run gemma2
```

**Important**: you need to pull the embeddings:

```console
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

You might also want to set the OLLAMA_HOST env variable in case your Ollama isn't listening on default 127.0.0.1:11434

### ChatGPT/OpenAI

You can use ChatGPT as an LLM by using the openai identifier:

```
openai:gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct
openai:gpt-4o
```

You need to set your OpenAI **API Key** before running:

```console
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

> **Note:**
>
> Using the OpenAI API may incur costs. Please refer to the OpenAI pricing page for more details.

# Usage

## Simple API

Create an agent:

```python
agent = Agent("aethelland-demo")
question = "How many people live in the country?"
text = agent.run(question)
```

Agent objects can either read its configuration from a YAML config file like the example, or use a dictionary:

```Python
    config = Config()
    config.load_conf_dict({
        "name": "my-demo",
        "llm": {
            "model-identifier": "ollama:gemma:latest",
            "embeddings": "nomic-embed-text"
        },
    })
    agent = Agent(config=config)
```

The agent supports both streaming and synchronous runs and can store a history, which is useful for chat-based applications. Texts from documents, URLs, or strings can be stored in vectorstores or used as inline context. Inline context directly provides the text to the LLM prompt but is limited by the LLM's context window.

## Micros

Micros are functional agents that serve 1 particular job, and can be used in pipes or chains.
There are currently agents for analyzing diffs, semantic unittest validation, summarizing text and handling websites. 

### Website Summary

```Python
agent = WebsiteSummaryAgent(url)
summary = agent.run()
```

### Semantic Unittests

```Python
class TestTextValidator(SemanticTestCase):
    def test_semantic(self):
        self.assertSemanticallyEqual("Blue is the sky.", "The sky is blue.")
```

### Diff Analysis

This example first creates a detailed textual summary, and in the second step it creates a shorter summary, which can be used e.g. in commit messages.

```Python
agent = DiffDetailsAgent(diff_text)
detailed_answer = agent.run()

sum_agent = DiffSumAgent(detailed_answer)
sum_answer = sum_agent.run()
```

```Console
git diff HEAD | cli_agents/diff_details
```

### Text Summary

Generic text summarization. You can choose local LLMs or cloud (CHatGPT).

```Python
agent = SumAgent(text, mode='local')
result = agent.run()
```

For further understanding of how to use Agent-Assembly-Line, the [tests](tests/async/test.py) can be read, as well as the [demo app](app/) and [examples](examples/).

The demo app also shows how the library can be used in a chat application.
See also [Build and run the demo app](#build-and-run-the-demo-app).

## Multi-Agent Chains

Micros can be used in combination, to build a [complex..]

Example:

```console
git diff --cached | examples/diff_analysis.py | examples/summarize_text.py
```

Or in Python:

```Python
agent = DiffDetailsAgent(diff_text)
detailed_answer = agent.run()

sum_agent = DiffSumAgent(detailed_answer)
sum_answer = sum_agent.run("Please summarize these code changes in 2-3 sentences.  The context is only for the bigger picture.")

sum_agent = DiffSumAgent(sum_answer)
sum_answer = sum_agent.run()
```
