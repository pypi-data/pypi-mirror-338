major_changes:
- Task Execution / Forks - Forks no longer inherit stdio from the parent
  ``ansible-playbook`` process. ``stdout``, ``stderr``, and ``stdin``
  within a worker are detached from the terminal, and non-functional. All
  needs to access stdio from a fork for controller side plugins requires
  use of ``Display``.
