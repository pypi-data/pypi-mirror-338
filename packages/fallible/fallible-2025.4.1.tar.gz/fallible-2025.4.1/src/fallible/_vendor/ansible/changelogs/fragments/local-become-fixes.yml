minor_changes:
  - local connection plugin - A new ``become_success_timeout`` operation-wide timeout config (default 10s) was added for ``become``.
  - local connection plugin - A new ``become_strip_preamble`` config option (default True) was added; disable to preserve diagnostic ``become`` output in task results.
  - local connection plugin - When a ``become`` plugin's ``prompt`` value is a non-string after the ``check_password_prompt`` callback has completed, no prompt stripping will occur on stderr.

bugfixes:
  - local connection plugin - Fixed silent ignore of ``become`` failures and loss of task output when data arrived concurrently on stdout and stderr during ``become`` operation validation.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed hang or spurious failure when data arrived concurrently on stdout and stderr during a successful ``become`` operation validation.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed task output header truncation when post-become data arrived before ``become`` operation validation had completed.
  - local connection plugin - Ensure ``become`` success validation always occurs, even when an active plugin does not set ``prompt``.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed cases where the internal ``BECOME-SUCCESS`` message appeared in task output.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed long timeout/hang for ``become`` plugins that repeat their prompt on failure (e.g., ``sudo``, some ``su`` implementations).
  - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when an active become plugin incorrectly signals lack of prompt.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when a become plugin expects a prompt but a password was not provided.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when an internal become read timeout expired before the password prompt was written.
  - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when only one of stdout or stderr was closed by the ``become_exe`` subprocess.
  - local connection plugin - Become timeout errors now include all received data. Previously, the most recently-received data was discarded.
  - sudo become plugin - The `sudo_chdir` config option allows the current directory to be set to the specified value before executing sudo to avoid permission errors when dropping privileges.
  - su become plugin - Ensure generated regex from ``prompt_l10n`` config values is properly escaped.
  - su become plugin - Ensure that password prompts are correctly detected in the presence of leading output. Previously, this case resulted in a timeout or hang.
  - su become plugin - Ensure that trailing colon is expected on all ``prompt_l10n`` config values.
  - ansible-test - Managed macOS instances now use the ``sudo_chdir`` option for the ``sudo`` become plugin to avoid permission errors when dropping privileges.
