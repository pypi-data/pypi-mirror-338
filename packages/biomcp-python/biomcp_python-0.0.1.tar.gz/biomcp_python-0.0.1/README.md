# BioMCP: Biomedical Model Context Protocol

BioMCP provides LLMs with structured access to critical biomedical databases
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Tools

- PubTator3 (PubMed/PMC)
  - Article Search
  - Full Text
- ClinicalTrials.gov
  - Clinical Trial Advanced Search
  - Protocols
  - Outcomes
  - Locations
  - Reference
- MyVariant.info
  - Variant Search
  - Annotations (CIViC, ClinVar, COSMIC, dbSNP, etc.)

## Installation

To install the BioMCP package to use it as a Python package or Command Line
Interface (CLI), run the following command:

```bash
pip install biomcp
```

Or preferably:

```bash
uv pip install biomcp
```

To install it as a MCP Server to Claude Desktop or similar "MCP Clients", try
something like:

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "biomcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "biomcp", "run"]
    }
  }
}
```

To test the MCP Server, using the MCP Inspector, run the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run biomcp run
```

## Command Line Interface

BioMCP provides a comprehensive CLI for direct interaction with biomedical
databases:

```bash
# Get help
biomcp --help

# Run the MCP server
biomcp run

# Search for articles
biomcp article search --gene BRAF --disease Melanoma

# Get article details by PMID
biomcp article get 21717063 --full

# Search for clinical trials
biomcp trial search --condition "Lung Cancer" --phase Phase_3

# Get trial details by NCT ID
biomcp trial get NCT04280705 Protocol

# Search for variants
biomcp variant search --gene BRAF --significance Pathogenic

# Get variant details
