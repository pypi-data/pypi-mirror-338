# Implement YAML Serialization for Flock Systems

## Summary

Add YAML serialization and deserialization support for complete Flock systems.

## Description

This task involves extending the Flock class with methods to save and load entire agent systems in YAML format. A Flock system can contain multiple agents, routers, tools, and context data, making it more complex than individual agent serialization. This implementation will allow developers to create, share, and modify complete agent systems using a human-readable format with strong support for complex nested structures.

## User Story

[US007-YAML-Serialization](.project/userstories/US007-YAML-Serialization.md)

## Technical Requirements

1. Add methods to the Flock class:
   - `save_to_yaml_file()`: Save a complete Flock system to a YAML file
   - `load_from_yaml_file()`: Load a complete Flock system from a YAML file
2. Create a structured YAML format that organizes agents, tools, and system settings
3. Handle references between agents for handoff routers
4. Manage serialization of global context
5. Include helpful comments and documentation in the generated YAML
6. Use YAML anchors and references where appropriate for complex relationships

## Test Requirements

The following tests should be implemented to verify the Flock system YAML serialization functionality:

1. **Basic Flock System Tests**:
   - Test serializing a simple Flock with one agent
   - Test round-trip serialization (save to YAML and load back)
   - Verify all basic properties are preserved after serialization cycle

2. **Multi-Agent System Tests**:
   - Test serializing a Flock with multiple agents
   - Verify all agents are correctly serialized and preserved
   - Test that agent relationships and ordering are maintained

3. **Workflow Tests**:
   - Test serializing a Flock with handoff workflows between agents
   - Verify that agent routing connections are preserved
   - Test executing a complete workflow after deserialization

4. **Context Serialization Tests**:
   - Test serializing a Flock with custom context values
   - Verify context data is correctly preserved
   - Test how context references are maintained between agents

5. **Tool Registry Tests**:
   - Test serializing a Flock with registered tools
   - Verify tools are correctly preserved and accessible to all agents
   - Test for proper tool namespacing and reference resolution

6. **System Configuration Tests**:
   - Test serializing system-level configurations (model, logging settings)
   - Verify configurations are correctly preserved
   - Test loading configurations with overridden values

7. **Format and Structure Tests**:
   - Verify YAML file structure matches the specification
   - Test that generated comments are informative and correctly placed
   - Verify human-readability metrics (indentation, organization, naming)

8. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Test loading malformed YAML systems
   - Test handling missing or invalid agent references
   - Test handling of conflicting agent names or definitions

9. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create a full system test with multiple agents, tools, and workflows
   - Save, load, and execute the system
   - Compare results with the original system

All tests should use pytest fixtures and follow the project's testing conventions.

## Implementation Plan

1. Extend the Flock class with YAML serialization methods:
   - Implement `save_to_yaml_file(file_path: str, start_agent: str | None = None, input: dict | None = None)` method
   - Implement `load_from_yaml_file(cls, file_path: str)` class method
2. Design a YAML structure for Flock systems:
   - Top-level system configuration
   - Section for each agent
   - Global tools section
   - References for agent connections
3. Handle agent and tool serialization:
   - Call individual agent serialization methods
   - Organize tools in a central registry section
4. Manage handoff references between agents
5. Add documentation comments to the generated YAML
6. Create comprehensive test cases for:
   - Single-agent systems
   - Multi-agent workflows with handoffs
   - Systems with custom tools and evaluators
7. Update documentation with examples

## Definition of Done

1. Complete Flock systems can be saved to YAML files
2. Flock systems can be loaded from YAML files with all functionality preserved
3. Generated YAML files are human-readable and include helpful comments
4. Complex systems with multiple agents and handoffs work correctly
5. Edge cases (custom tools, evaluators, modules) are handled correctly
6. Unit tests verify the serialization cycle works correctly
7. Documentation is updated with YAML examples
