        - Sensor: subclass of SensorBase.
        - path: directory in which data is recorded.

        - ctrl_ppties: optional iterable of properties (ControlledProperty
                       objects) to control on the recording in addition to
                       default ones (time interval and active on/off)

                  True (note: data acquired during periods with saving=False
                  will not be saved later. This happens e.g. when one just
                  want to plot data without saving it).
        - continuous: if True, take data as fast as possible from sensor.
        - warnings: if True, print warnings of Timer (e.g. loop too short).
        - precise: if True, use precise timer in oclock (see oclock.Timer).
        - immediate: if False, changes in the timer (e.g interval) occur
                     at the next timestep. If True, a new data point is
                     taken immediately.

                    between data points after some time, etc.)

                          to the program controls (e.g. dt, range_limits, etc.)
                          Note: if None, use default params
                          (see RecordingControl class)
