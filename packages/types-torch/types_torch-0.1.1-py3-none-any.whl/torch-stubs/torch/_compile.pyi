    This API should be only used inside torch, external users should still use
    torch._dynamo.disable. The main goal of this API is to avoid circular
    imports issues that is common while using _dynamo.disable inside torch
    itself.

    This API avoids it by lazily importing torch._dynamo from the import time to
    the invocation of the decorated function.
