              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# JAX Datetime: JAX compatible datetime and timedelta types

JAX Datetime implements basic datetime and timedelta functionality in a JAX
compatible fashion. JAX Datetime's `Datetime` and `Timedelta` classes can hold
arrays of values and are JAX pytrees, which makes them compatible with JAX
transformations such as `jax.vmap` and `jax.jit`.

## Typical usage

You can create `Timedelta` and `Datetime` objects either directly, or via the
`to_timedelta` and `to_datetime` helpers, which also handle NumPy and datetime
objects:

    >>> import jax_datetime as jdt

    >>> delta = jdt.to_timedelta(1, 'day')

    >>> delta
    jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=1, seconds=0)

    >>> time = jdt.to_datetime('2000-01-01')

    >>> time
    jax_datetime.Datetime(delta=jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=10957, seconds=0))

`Timedelta` and `Datetime` objects support arithmetic like standard datetime
objects, including with built-in datetime and scalar NumPy objects:

    >>> time + delta
    jax_datetime.Datetime(delta=jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=10958, seconds=0))

    >>> time + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    jax_datetime.Datetime(delta=jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=10958, seconds=0))

You can also construct them from multidimensional arrays, in which case they
support basic array properties like `shape` and `__getitem__` :

    >>> days = jdt.to_timedelta(jnp.arange(5), 'days')

    >>> days
    jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=[0 1 2 3 4], seconds=[0 0 0 0 0])

    >>> days.shape
    (5,)

    >>> days[-1]
    jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=4, seconds=0)

Finally, you can convert back to standard NumPy or Python datetime objects using
the `to_datetime64`, `to_pydatetime`, `to_timedelta64` and `to_pytimedelta`
methods:

    >>> time.to_pydatetime()
    datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0)

    >>> delta.to_timedelta64()
    numpy.timedelta64(86400,'s')

## Pytree operations

`Timedelta` and `Datetime` objects are JAX pytrees, which means they can be
used as inputs to JAX transformations such as `jax.vmap`, `jax.jit` and
`jax.lax.scan` (`jax.grad` is not supported, because JAX Datetime uses integers
internally to store data):

    >>> jax.jit(lambda x: x + delta)(time)
    jax_datetime.Datetime(delta=jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=10958, seconds=0))

This is also helpful for re-arranging multi-dimensional arrays of `Timedelta`
and `Datetime` objects, e.g., using `jnp.stack` and `jnp.concat`:

    >>> import jax

    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp

    >>> jax.tree.map(lambda *xs: jnp.stack(xs), time, time + delta)
    jax_datetime.Datetime(delta=jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=[10957 10958], seconds=[0 0]))

In fact, `__getitem__` on `Timedelta` and `Datetime` objects is implemented
in exactly such as a fashion.

**Warning**: Do not modify _values_ on the arrays underlying JAX Datetime
objects directly using JAX pytree operations (e.g., `jax.tree.map`). In such
cases, normalization from JAX Datetime constructors will be skipped, and you may
create invalid objects, for which some operations (e.g., comparisons for
equality) will give silently incorrect results:

    >>> import jax

    >>> hour = jdt.to_timedelta(1, 'hour')

    >>> invalid_delta = jax.tree.map(lambda x: 24 * x, hour)  # don't do this!

    >>> invalid_delta
    jax_datetime.Timedelta(days=0, seconds=86400)

    >>> delta == invalid_delta  # untrue!
    False

## Implementation

Under the hood, `Timedelta` stores its state in integer arrays of `days` and
`seconds`. `Datetime` is implemented as a simple wrapper around `Timedelta`,
indicating a time difference relative to the start of the Unix Epoch
(1970-01-01).

Like datetime.timedelta, the seconds field in `Timedelta` is always normalized
to fall in the range `[0, 24*60*60)`, with whole days moved into `days`. Using
JAX's default int32 precision, Timedelta can exactly represent durations over 5
million years.

Currently, `Timedelta` and `Datetime` objects are implemented as JAX pytrees,
We will likely switch the implementation to make use of custom dtypes if they
are supported by JAX in the future.

The underlying integer array types wrapped by JAX-Datetime may be either NumPy
or JAX arrays. NumPy arrays are preserved by the constructor, but the results of
any computation will likely be JAX arrays.
