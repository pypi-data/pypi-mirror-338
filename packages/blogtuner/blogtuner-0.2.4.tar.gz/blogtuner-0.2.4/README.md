## ü§î Motivation

Some folks such as [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) have convinced me to start blogging my thoughts. I wanted to keep things simple‚Äîjust a dumb set of markdown files should be enough to create a super simple HTML blog.

Even with great tools like [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) available, they felt too complicated for what I needed. I wanted the minimal expression of simplicity. Hence, BlogTuner was born.

The idea is to keep your markdown files in a repo, generate HTML with BlogTuner, and deploy to a service like GitHub Pages. As simple as that.

## üì¶ Installation

The recommended way to use BlogTuner is via `uvx` (by the way, if you haven't heard about `uv` you should [read about it](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):

```bash
uvx blogtuner build source_dir target_dir
```

If you prefer to install it:

```bash
uv pip install blogtuner
```

You can use the traditional `pip` workflow without `uv` as well.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create a new blog directory
mkdir myblog
cd myblog

# Create your first post
echo "# Hello World" > first-post.md

# Generate your blog
uvx blogtuner build . _site
```

### Smart File Organization

BlogTuner automatically renames your files to follow the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`.

**NEW**: Git-aware file renaming! üéâ

When BlogTuner normalizes your file names, it now intelligently detects if the file is part of a Git repository:

- If the file is tracked in Git, it uses `git mv` to rename it, preserving your Git history
- If not, it falls back to a regular file system rename

This makes BlogTuner play nicely with your Git workflow while keeping everything organized.

### Frontmatter

Posts can include TOML frontmatter at the beginning of the file (if you don't include it, it will be generated during the first run):

```markdown
+++
title = "My Awesome Post"
pubdate = "2024-03-28"
draft = false
slug = "custom-slug"  # Optional, defaults to filename
+++

# My Awesome Post

Content goes here...
```

### Blog Configuration

Create a `blog.toml` in your source directory (it will be created on the first run if you're lazy like me):

```toml
name = "My Awesome Blog"
author = "Your Name"
base_url = "https://yourdomain.com"
base_path = "/"
lang = "en"
tz = "UTC"
footer_text = "Powered by <a href='https://github.com/alltuner/blogtuner'>Blogtuner</a>"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Features in Detail

### Post Processing

- **Automatic Metadata**: Extract frontmatter or use defaults
- **Date Handling**: Parse dates from frontmatter or use file timestamps
- **Drafts**: Drafts won't appear in the index or feed
- **File Normalization**: Files renamed to YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md with Git awareness

### Site Generation

- **HTML Generation**: Clean, simple HTML for each post and index
- **Feed Generation**: Atom feed for syndication
- **CSS Bundling**: Simple, clean CSS included automatically
- **Fast Processing**: Efficient even for large numbers of posts
