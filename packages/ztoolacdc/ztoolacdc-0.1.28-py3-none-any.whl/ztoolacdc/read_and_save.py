multiple_s.__doc__ = """
Function that reads Multiple Simulations results and saves them into a dedicated file and/or loads them into memory for further processing.
The function accepts several input arguments to customize the reading:
Required
        n_sim		 Number of simulation results to be read: total number of simulations.
        original_folder	 Absolute path of the folder where the results can be found.
        file_name	 Common name of the files to be read.       

Optional
        output		 Boolean variable to control if the read results should be returned as an array. output = True returns an array with the results.
        save		 Boolean variable to control the saving of the read data. False means the data is not saved.
        new_folder	 Absolute path of the destination folder in case save = True.
        output_filename	 Output file name: no extension needed. By default it saves the data into .txt files where the first column is the time and the rest
                         are the concatenated extracted variables from each simulation in the order that they where performed.

Furthermore, there is an additional internal parameter that indicates how many variables are read from each file. For impedance computation
only two currents and voltages are needed, thus n = 4 variables.
