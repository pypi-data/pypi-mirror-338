        save_td  		        Bool: If set to True, many files of time domain data are saved into more compact .txt files for each independent
                                perturbation. The format is [time Vd(f1) Vq(f1) Id(f1) Iq(f1) ... Vd(f_max) Vq(f_max) Id(f_max) Iq(f_max)].
        run_sim                 Bool flag to run or not run all PSCAD simulations. True = runs PSCAD, False = does NOT run PSCAD
        verbose                 Bool flag to show detailed debugging and processing information.
