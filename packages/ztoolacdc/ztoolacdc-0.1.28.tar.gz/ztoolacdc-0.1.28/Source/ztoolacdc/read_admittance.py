Function to read the addmittance text files as obtained with the tool.

The result is an Admittance object which contains the admittance matrix, frequencies, variable names, type of matrix, etc. See the Admittance class for more information.
Either file_name or involved_blocks need to be specified.

Required arguments
        path                (string) Directory where the file is located.
        file_name           (string) Full name of the file, including extension. Either this or the involved_blocks argument is required.

Optional arguments
        involved_blocks     (list of strings) It contains the names of the PSCAD blocks with the side at the end separated with a hyphen, e.g. ["BlockA-2","BlockB-1"] denotes the admittance between side 2 of BlockA and side 1 of BlockB.
        file_root           (string) Starting part of the file name. It can be used when several study cases are performed with different names as the involved_blocks variable is the same.

Returns
        Admittance object.
