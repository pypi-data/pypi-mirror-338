# Spatialize: A Python wrapper for C++ ESI library

## What is it?

Spatialize is an open source library that implements _ensemble spatial interpolation_, 
a novel method that combines the simplicity of basic interpolation methods with 
the power of classical geoestatistical tools, like Kriging.

This library aims to bridge the gap between expert and non-expert users of geostatistics 
by providing automated tools that rival traditional geostatistical methods.


Main features of the library include:

- Stochastic modelling and ensemble learning, making it robust, scalable and suitable for large datasets.
- Provides a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification, offering both point estimates and empirical posterior distributions.
- It is implemented in Python 3.x, with a C++ core for improved performance.
- It is designed to be easy to use, requiring minimal user intervention. 

## Where to get it
