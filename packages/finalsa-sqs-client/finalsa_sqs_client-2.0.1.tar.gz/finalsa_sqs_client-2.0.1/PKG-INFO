# Sqs client 

This is a simple SQS client that can be used to send and receive messages from an SQS queue.

It uses the boto3 library to interact with the SQS service.

The client is designed to be used with the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

It is a simple wrapper around the boto3 SQS client that provides a more user-friendly interface.
