# NarrativeMapper

**Overview:**

The NarrativeMapper package is a discourse analysis pipeline that uncovers the dominant narratives and emotional tones within online communities.

This project processes textual messages from .csv files, then applies OpenAI’s embedding API (text-embedding-3-large) to convert each message into semantic vectors. These embeddings are clustered using UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN for density-based clustering.

For each discovered cluster, the tool:

- Extracts the main talking points OpenAI Chat Completions

- Analyzes the emotional tone using a Hugging Face sentiment classifier

- Outputs structured summaries of the narrative + emotion pairs

Install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/NarrativeMapper/):


**Example Output:**

This example is based off of 1800 r/antiwork comments from the top 300 posts within the last year (Date of Writing: 2025-04-03). 

Output using **format_to_dict()** function. Useful for JSON export.

Two other formatting functions are available, format_by_text() and format_by_cluster(), both return pandas DataFrames that are well-suited for CSV export.

**format_by_cluster()** returns columns:

- online_group_name - online group name

- cluster_label - cluster summary/label

- comment_count - sampled textual messages per cluster

- aggregated_sentiment - net sentiment, of form 'NEGATIVE', 'POSITIVE', 'NEUTRAL'

- all_sentiments - this is a list containing dict items of the form '{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9896971583366394}' for each message (sentiment calculated by distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english).

**format_by_text()** returns columns:

- online_group_name - online group name

- cluster_label - cluster summary/label the textual message belongs to

- text - the sampled textual message (this function returns all of them row by row)

- sentiment - dict item holding sentiment calculation, of the form '{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9896971583366394}' (sentiment calculated by distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english).

**Pipeline Architecture:**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSV Text Data --> Embeddings (embeddings.py) --> Cluster (clustering.py) --> Summarize (summarize.py)  --> Formatting (formatters.py)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*embeddings.py:*
Converts textual messages into 3072 dimensional vectors (OPEN AI's text-embedding-3-large).

*clustering.py:*
Clusters embedding vectors using UMAP for reduction and HDBSCAN for clustering.

*summarize.py:*
Determines summaries/label-names (4o-gpt-mini Chat Completion) and sentiment (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for each cluster. 

*formatters.py:*
Formats summarized clusters into useful forms for data analysis.


**How to Use:**

**IMPORTANT:**

To use this package, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Create a .env file in your root directory (same folder where your script runs).

Inside the .env file, add your API key like this:

```dotenv
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

The package will automatically load your key using python-dotenv. (Make sure to keep your .env file private and add it to your .gitignore if you're using Git.)


*Option 1: High-Level Class-Based Interface*

```python
#initialize NarrativeMapper object
mapper = NarrativeMapper("r/antiwork")

#embeds semantic vectors
mapper.load_embeddings("path/to/your/file.csv")

#clustering: n_components, n_neighbors are UMAP variables. min_cluser_size, min_samples are HDBSCAN variables.
mapper.cluster(n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)

#summarize each cluster's topic and sentiment
mapper.summarize()

#export in your preferred format
summary_dict = mapper.format_to_dict()
text_df = mapper.format_by_text()
cluster_df = mapper.format_by_cluster()

#saving DataFrames to csv
text_df.to_csv("comments_by_cluster.csv", index=False)
cluster_df.to_csv("cluster_summary.csv", index=False)
```

---

*Option 2: Low-Level Functional Interface*


```python
#manual control over each step:
embeddings = get_embeddings("path/to/your/file.csv")
cluster_df = cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)
summary_df = summarize_clusters(cluster_df)

#export/format options
summary_dict = format_to_dict(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
text_df = format_by_text(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
cluster_df = format_by_cluster(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
```
