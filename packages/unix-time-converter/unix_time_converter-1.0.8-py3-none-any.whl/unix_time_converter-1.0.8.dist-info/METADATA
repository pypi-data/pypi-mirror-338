## Unixtime Converter

The Unixtime Converter is a lightweight python program with a Tkinter-GUI. 
It calculates local time or UTC into an unixtimestamp or vice versa. Basically 
it can be used and downloaded by everybody. Unixtime is mainly used in the IT.

## Installation/Setup

Currently the setup is only tested on linuxbased os with python3 minimumversion 3.9
To start the setup use pip:

    pip install unix-time-converter

A setup Windows 10 or 11 will follow soon.

## How it works

The program needs exactly 2 parameters to calculate the requested time:
* select a timezone from the list
* fill in a unixtimestamp or localtime or utc and click on the butten left of the field
All 3 fields for time will be filled/calculated

Basically it's not needed to click on the resetbutton. It's for more clearance for the usage. If you click on it all entriefields for time (localtime, utc-time and unixtime) are cleared.<br><br>
If you change one timefield (and both other timefields containing values) and you click on the button beside of this field all other (time-)fields are recalculated.

done - that's it!
