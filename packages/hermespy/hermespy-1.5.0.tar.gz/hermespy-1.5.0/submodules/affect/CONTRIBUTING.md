# Contributing Guidelines

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
expand this project. Here are some important resources to communicate with us:

- [The official website](http://aff3ct.github.io),
- Bugs? [Report issues on GitHub](https://github.com/aff3ct/aff3ct/issues).

## Submitting changes

Please send a
[GitHub Pull Request to AFF3CT](https://github.com/aff3ct/aff3ct/pull/new/)
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Please
make your modifications on the ``develop`` branch, any pull to the
``master`` branch will be refused (the ``master`` is dedecated to the releases).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Regression Testing

We maintain a database of BER/FER reference simulations. Please give us some new
references which solicit the code you added. We use those references in
[an automated regression test script](https://github.com/aff3ct/aff3ct/blob/master/ci/test-regression.py).
To propose new references please use our
[dedicated repository](https://github.com/aff3ct/error_rate_references) and send
us a pull request on it.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. For the readability, we
apply some coding conventions:

- we indent using tabulation (hard tabs),
- we ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (``[1, 2, 3]``,
  not ``[1,2,3]``), around operators (``x += 1``, not ``x+=1``), and around
  hash arrows,
- we use the [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
  (``my_variable``, not ``myVariable``), classes start with an upper case
  (`My_class`, not `my_class`) and variables/methods/functions start with a
  lower case,
- the number of characters is limited to 120 per line of code.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and
make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love
doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride
as smooth as possible.
