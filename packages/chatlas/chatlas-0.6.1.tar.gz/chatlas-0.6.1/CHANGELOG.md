### Bug fixes

* Fixed a missing dependency on the `requests` package.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-04-01

### New features

* New `content_pdf_file()` and `content_pdf_url()` allow you to upload PDFs to supported models. (#74)

### Improvements

* `Turn` and `Content` now inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel` to provide easier saving to and loading from JSON. (#72)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-03-18

### New features

* Added a `ChatSnowflake()` class to interact with [Snowflake Cortex LLM](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions). (#54)
* Added a `ChatAuto()` class, allowing for configuration of chat providers and models via environment variables. (#38, thanks @mconflitti-pbc)

### Improvements

* Updated `ChatAnthropic()`'s `model` default to `"claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"`. (#62)
* The version is now accessible as `chatlas.__version__`. (#64)
* All provider-specific `Chat` subclasses now have an associated extras in chatlas. For example, `ChatOpenAI` has `chatlas[openai]`, `ChatPerplexity` has `chatlas[perplexity]`, `ChatBedrockAnthropic` has `chatlas[bedrock-anthropic]`, and so forth for the other `Chat` classes. (#66)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue with content getting duplicated when it overflows in a `Live()` console. (#71)
* Fix an issue with tool calls not working with `ChatVertex()`. (#61)


## [0.4.0] - 2025-02-19

### New features

* Added a `ChatVertex()` class to interact with Google Cloud's Vertex AI. (#50)
* Added `.app(*, echo=)` support. This allows for chatlas to change the echo behavior when running the Shiny app. (#31)

### Improvements

* Migrated `ChatGoogle()`'s underlying python SDK from `google-generative` to `google-genai`. As a result, streaming tools are now working properly. (#50)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where synchronous chat tools would not work properly when used in a `_async()` context. (#56)
* Fix broken `Chat`'s Shiny app when `.app(*, stream=True)` by using async chat tools. (#31)
* Update formatting of exported markdown to use `repr()` instead of `str()` when exporting tool call results. (#30)

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-20

### New features

* `Chat`'s `.tokens()` method gains a `values` argument. Set it to `"discrete"` to get a result that can be summed to determine the token cost of submitting the current turns. The default (`"cumulative"`), remains the same (the result can be summed to determine the overall token cost of the conversation).
* `Chat` gains a `.token_count()` method to help estimate token cost of new input. (#23)

### Bug fixes

* `ChatOllama` no longer fails when a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set.
* `ChatOpenAI` now correctly includes the relevant `detail` on `ContentImageRemote()` input.
* `ChatGoogle` now correctly logs its `token_usage()`. (#23)
