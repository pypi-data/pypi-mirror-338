        About
        =====
        
        This package provides a ReactJS based listing tables for SENAITE LIMS.
        
        `ReactJS`_ is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
        building user interfaces built by `Facebook`_ and is licensed under the `MIT`_
        License.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Please follow the installations instructions for `Plone 5`_ and
        `senaite.lims`_.
        
        To install SENAITE.APP.LISTING, you have to add `senaite.app.listing` into the
        `eggs` list inside the `[buildout]` section of your `buildout.cfg`::
        
           [buildout]
           index = https://pypi.org/simple/
           extends = https://dist.plone.org/release/5.2-latest/versions.cfg
           find-links =
               https://dist.plone.org/release/5.2-latest/
               https://dist.plone.org/thirdparty/
           eggs =
               Plone
               senaite.lims
           zcml =
           eggs-directory = ${buildout:directory}/eggs
        
           [instance]
           recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
           user = admin:admin
           http-address = 127.0.0.1:8080
           eggs =
               ${buildout:eggs}
           zcml =
               ${buildout:zcml}
        
        
        **Note**
        
        The above example works for the buildout created by the unified
        installer. If you however have a custom buildout you might need to add
        the egg to the `eggs` list in the `[instance]` section rather than
        adding it in the `[buildout]` section.
        
        Also see this section of the Plone documentation for further details:
        https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installing_addons.html
        
        **Important**
        
        For the changes to take effect you need to re-run buildout from your
        console::
        
           bin/buildout
