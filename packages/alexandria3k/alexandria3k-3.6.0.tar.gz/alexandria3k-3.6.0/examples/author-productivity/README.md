# Author productivity over the years

Determine relative author productivity in terms of works authored
per year.  The productivity should be assessed in relative terms (adjusting
for 1945 = 1), because authors with same names increase its absolute
value.
However, assuming that the ratio of clashing names in the population does not
change, the effect of duplicate names on the relative productivity
measurements is cancelled out.

As an example consider that 50% of all authors are named Smith,
and in 1945 100 authors write 100 works.
The actual productivity should be 1.
It will however appear as 50 authors writing 100 works, i.e. a
productivity of 2.
Consider now in 2020 1000 authors writing 4000 works.
The actual productivity should be 4.
It will however appear as 500 authors writing 4000 works, i.e. a
productivity of 8.
While the derived absolute productivity numbers are incorrect,
their ratios are the same: 1/4 = 2/8.
