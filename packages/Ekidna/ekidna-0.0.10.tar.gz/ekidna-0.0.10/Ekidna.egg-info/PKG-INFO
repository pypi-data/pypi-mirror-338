This library contains functions and classes for analysis of, primarily, data collected from 
electrochemistry experiments. Various functions may be useful beyond the scope of electrochemistry.

Examples of tools include: baseline subtraction, pairplots, histograms, standard curve creators, smoothing, etc . . . 

The code is developed by researchers at Ekidna Sensing.
