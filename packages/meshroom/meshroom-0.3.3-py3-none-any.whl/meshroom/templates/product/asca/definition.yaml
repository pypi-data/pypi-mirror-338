  Specifically, ASCA helps with the following three phases of CTEM:
  - Discovery: Identify misconfiguration of technical security controls and correlate it with asset, vulnerability and exposure data from integrated exposure assessment sources.
  - Prioritization: Overlay the control context with the asset, vulnerability and exposure context from adjacent exposure assessment tools to effectively prioritize exposures.
  - Mobilization: Provide specific mitigation guidance for implementation in technical security controls. Example mitigations include configuration change, custom detection rule and virtual patch.
