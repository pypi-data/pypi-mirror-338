  Must-Have Capabilities
  The must-have capabilities of this market include:
  - Both inline (via identity-aware proxy supporting managed and unmanaged devices)
  and out-of-band (via API) protection of in-use SaaS apps including adaptive access,
  encrypted traffic visibility and control, data loss prevention (DLP), malware
  protection and threat prevention.
  - Adaptive and granular access (controlled by identity and context) to private and
  SaaS applications by both agent and agentless methods, and from managed and
  unmanaged devices.
  - Integration with identity providers for identity context and validation.

  Standard
  The standard capabilities of this market include:
  - Ability to apply controls consistently across multiple network and application
  destinations.
  - Support for managing and securing traffic from common endpoints (such as
  Windows, macOS, iOS and Android devices).
  - Integration with key enterprise technologies such as security information and event
  management (SIEM), extended detection and response (XDR), SD-WAN, and other
  adjacent technologies.
  - Support for published and documented APIs that are accessible to the customer and
  that allow automation of common tasks and integration with other security
  platforms.
  - Curated, managed, and risk-scored catalog of SaaS applications.
  - Support for controlled access from managed and unmanaged devices.

  Optional Capabilities
  The optional capabilities of this market include:
  - Control over all ports and protocols.
  - Remote browser isolation (RBI) to enhance security across all network destinations
  and channels.
  - SaaS security posture management for visibility and remediation of SaaS
  configurations and visibility into SaaS plug-in applications.
  - Continuous adaptive access controls across all channels based on initial connection
  status and any change in state during connection.
  - Read, write and act upon labels from common data classification platforms.
  - Embedded user entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to provide automated detection and
  response for anomalous and risky device and user behaviors.
  - Advanced data protection capabilities such as redaction, tombstoning, and on-the-fly
  encryption (both in-line and out-of-band) and advanced data detection capabilities
  such as exact data matching (EDM), optical character recognition (OCR) and
  machine learning (ML) classifiers.
