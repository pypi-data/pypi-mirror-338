  Mandatory Features
  The mandatory features for services in this market include:
  Indicators of compromise (IoCs), including malicious or suspicious ratings, such as IP addresses, URLs, domains and file hashes.
  Direct technical intelligence collection or research, enabling the consumer to tailor collection or search functionality for relevant IoCs.
  Configuration of alerting thresholds based on predefined criteria.
  Machine-to-machine integrations to either push or pull intelligence artifacts through to multiple solutions.
  Out-of-the-box enrichments to IoCs, such as tentative attribution, geolocation data and registration information.
  An interactive user portal with built-in analysis functionalities such as contextualized dashboards, configurable alerting and search features.
  IOC scoring or risk rating as a way to illustrate confidence in maliciousness or suspiciousness.
  Investigative support options, which may include ad hoc requests-for-information, longer-term analysis or recurring analyst augmentation.

  Common Features
  The common features for this market include:
  TTP enrichment of IOCs, provided typically in two formats: threat actor profiles and MITRE ATT&CK enrichments.
  Malware sandboxing, providing the ability to dynamically extract IoCs from malware samples by detonating the malware in a provider (cloud or on-premises) sandbox.
  Vulnerability intelligence tailored for vulnerability prioritization, often highlighting actively exploited vulnerabilities and the associated IoCs.
  Finished intelligence reporting, including technical/tactical analysis reports as well as operational and strategic intelligence products.
  Visual representation of weighted connections between IOCs and threat actors
  Network telemetry enrichments such as passive DNS, sinkhole traffic and global sensor network telemetry.
  Industry-specific curation such as advanced search filters, industry-specific query parameters and dashboards.
  Built-in priority intelligence requirement curation.
  Metrics reporting tailored for operational governance.
  Forensic analysis support.
  Support for multi-format sharing methods across industry communities

  Optional
