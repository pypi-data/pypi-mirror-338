  Visibility of exposures alone can be delivered by many currently available tools. However, this is not enough. Threat exposure awareness must:
  1. Pair with business context impact
  2. Lead to exposure prioritization
  3. Convince responsible IT and development teams of the risk to the business 4. Ultimately deliver timely coordination for remediation of the exposure

  Proactive threat exposure management should include:
  - Programmatic approach that focuses on remediation
  - Integrated tech stack that enhances human involvement or, if possible, automates scoping, discovery, prioritization, validation and mobilization
  - Actionable remediation guidance options
  - Integration with threat detection, investigation and response insight to exposures

  Gartner recommends selecting a platform that provides:
  1. Asset scoping (identity, device, cloud, applications, digital assets)
  2. Asset criticality (business context)
  3. Attack path discovery/mapping
  4. Risk-based exposure prioritization
  5. Exploitation validation
  6. Remediation guidance
  7. Mobilization coordination for issues out of service provider reach or authority

  When trying to find the right scoping for a CTEM program pilot, good candidates include:
  - External attack surface — It combines a relatively narrow scope (for most organizations) and a growing ecosystem of tools.
  - SaaS security posture — While tool maturity is still lacking, increasing remote workforce led to more critical business data hosted on SaaS, ensuring easier communication about the risks.
  Later cycles could expand to include:
  - Digital risk protection which adds greater visibility into the attack surface.
  - Dark and deep web sources to identify potential threats to critical assets and provide contextual information on threat actors and the tactics and processes utilized to conduct malicious activity.
