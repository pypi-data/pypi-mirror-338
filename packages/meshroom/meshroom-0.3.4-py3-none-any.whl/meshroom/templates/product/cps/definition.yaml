  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered to orchestrate sensing, computation, control, networking and analytics in order to interact with the physical world.
  They underpin all smart and connected efforts, from operational technology in critical infrastructure to smart buildings, transportation, medical devices,
  and all upcoming robotics and automation efforts. When secure, CPS enable safe, real-time, reliable, resilient and adaptable performance.
  When not secure, they can lead to halted operations or worse, to human safety and environmental issues.
