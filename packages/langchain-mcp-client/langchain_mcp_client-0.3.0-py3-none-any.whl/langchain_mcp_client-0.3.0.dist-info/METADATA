# ü¶ú üîó LangChain MCP Client

[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/datalayer/langchain-mcp-client/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/datalayer/langchain-mcp-client/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-mcp-client)](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-mcp-client)

This simple [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client demonstrates the use of MCP server tools by LangChain ReAct Agent.

- üåê Seamlessly connect to any MCP servers.
- ü§ñ Use any LangChain-compatible LLM for flexible model selection.
- üí¨ Interact via CLI, enabling dynamic conversations.

## Conversion to LangChain Tools

It leverages a utility function `convert_mcp_to_langchain_tools()`. This function handles parallel initialization of specified multiple MCP servers and converts their available tools into a list of LangChain-compatible tools ([List[BaseTool]](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/tools/langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool.html#langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool)).

## Installation

The python version should be 3.11 or higher.

```bash
pip install langchain_mcp_client
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file containing all the necessary `API_KEYS` to access your LLM.

Configure the LLM, MCP servers, and prompt example in the `llm_mcp_config.json5` file:

1. **LLM Configuration**: Set up your LLM parameters.
2. **MCP Servers**: Specify the MCP servers to connect to.
3. **Example Queries**: Define example queries that invoke MCP server tools. Press Enter to use these example queries when prompted.

## Usage

Below an example with a [Jupyter MCP Server](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server):

Check the `llm_mcp_config.json5` configuration (commands depends if you are running on Linux or macOS/Windows).

```bash
# Start jupyterlab.
make jupyterlab
```

```bash
# Launch the CLI.
make cli
```

This is a prompt example.

```
create matplolib examples with many variants in jupyter
```
