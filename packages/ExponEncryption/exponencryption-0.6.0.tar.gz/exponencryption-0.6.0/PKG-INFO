## Installation

You can install ExponEncryption using pip:

```bash
pip install ExponEncryption
```

## Features

- Secure string encryption using exponential encryption algorithm
- Password-based encryption 

## Usage

### As a Library

```python
from ExponEncryption import Encrytion
# Create an instance of the encryption class
encryptor = Encrytion()

# Encrypt a message
message = "Hello, World!"
password = "your_secret_password"
encrypted_text, key = encryptor.encryption(message, password)

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_text = encryptor.decryption(encrypted_text, key, password)
print(decrypted_text)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

## Security Notes

- Keep your encryption password secure
- Never share your encryption key
- Store encrypted data and keys separately
- Use strong passwords for better security

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
