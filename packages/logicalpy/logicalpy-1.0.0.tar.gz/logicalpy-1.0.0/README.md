LogicalPy is a Python library providing basic functionalities for manipulating propositional logic.

## Description

The library allows to work with classical propositional logic formulae.
The main features include:

 - The construction of logical formulae either directly or from a string
 - The implementation of semantic notions: satisfiability, entailment...
 - The conversion to normal forms (NNF, DNF, DNF)
 - Automated theorem proving with the resolution procedure

For the complete documentation, see [https://cubix1729.github.io/logicalpy/](https://cubix1729.github.io/logicalpy/).

## Installation

With pip:
```
pip install logicalpy
```

Note than the library needs a Python version higher than 3.10.
