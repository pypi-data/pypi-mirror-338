<h2 id="overview">üìñ Overview</h2>

Maketree is a powerful CLI tool that generates **directories** and **files** based on a predefined structure. Instead of manually creating folders and files, just define your structure and let **Maketree** handle the rest.

<p align="center">

-   **Easy to Use**: Define a structure in plain text and generate it instantly.

<h2 id="features">üöÄ Features:</h2>

-   **Supports nested directory structures**
-   **Automatically creates missing parent directories**
-   **Flexible file handling with warning, skip, and overwrite options**
-   **Preview the directory tree before creation**
-   **Color support**

-   **Lightweight, fast, and has zero dependencies**
-   **Simple and user-friendly CLI**

<h2 id="installation">üì¶ Installation:</h2>

<h3 id="install-via-pip">Install via **pip**:</h3>

`Maketree` is available on PyPI. **(Recommended if you're a python developer and have python already installed on your system)**

You can install it using:

```sh
pip install maketree
```

`python>=3.8` must be installed on your system.

<h3 id="install-from-source">Install from **Source**:</h3>

If you are installing from source, you will need `python>=3.8`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Anas-Shakeel/maketree-cli.git
cd maketree-cli
pip install .
```

<h3 id="download-binaries-no-python-required">Download **Binaries**: _(No Python Required)_</h3>

Maketree provides standalone binaries for **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**. **(Recommended if you don't want to install Python.)**

-   Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/anas-shakeel/maketree-cli/releases/).

-   **(Optional)** Move the executable to a directory in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on **Linux/macOS** OR `C:\maketree` on **Windows**).

-   Run `maketree` from the terminal.

    ```sh
    maketree -h
    ```

<h2 id="quickstart">‚ö° Quickstart:</h2>

Define your project structure in a `.tree` file:

`structure.tree`

```plaintext
my_project/
    src/
        main.py
        utils.py
    tests/
        test_main.py
    README.md
    .gitignore
```

Then, run:

```sh
maketree structure.tree
```

This will instantly generate the entire structure in your current directory.

<h2 id="usage">‚öôÔ∏è Usage</h2>

You can `maketree` from any location in your terminal. **(If installed via `pip` or if moved the executable to a directory recognized by system's `PATH`)**

<h3 id="display-help">Display Help</h3>

```sh
maketree -h
```

This will show the available commands and options:

```sh

positional arguments:
  src                   source file (with .tree extension)

  -g, --graphical       show source file as graphical tree and exit
  -o, --overwrite       overwrite existing files
  -s, --skip            skip existing files
  -nc, --no-color       don't use colors in output

  -v, --verbose         enable verbose mode

Maketree 1.2.0
```

<h3 id="creating-a-directory-structure">Creating a Directory Structure</h3>

**Maketree** reads `.tree` file that defines the folder and file structure and then creates the corresponding structure on your filesystem.

<h4 id="define-the-structure">Define the Structure</h4>

Create a file named `myapp.tree`:

```
src/
    style.css
    app.js
    index.html
```

This will create a src folder with three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`.

#### Generate the Structure

To generate the structure, Run:

```sh
maketree myapp.tree
```

It will ask for confirmation with a graphical representation of the structure.

```sh
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
Create this structure? (y/N):
```

Output:

```sh
1 directory and 3 files have been created.
```

By default, maketree creates the structure in the current directory.

<h3 id="syntax-for-writing-a-tree-file">Syntax for Writing a `.tree` File</h3>

To ensure correctness, follow these simple points:

1. **Directories must end with `/`**
2. **Indentation must be exactly 4 spaces** _(other indentations may cause unexpected results)_
3. **File and directory names must be valid according to your OS**
4. **Comments start with `//`** _(inline comments are not supported)_

#### Example:

`myapp.tree`

```
// This is a comment, and is ignored by maketree.
node_modules/
public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    robots.txt
src/
    index.css
    index.js
.gitignore
package.json
README.md
```

Now, run:

```sh
maketree myapp.tree
```

Output: (After confirming)

```
3 directories and 8 files have been created.
```

<h3 id="specifying-a-destination-folder">Specifying a Destination Folder</h3>

You can specify a destination folder instead of creating the structure in the current directory.

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp/
```

It will throw an error if `myapp/` does not exist.

```sh
Error: destination path 'myapp' does not exist.
```

Use `--create-dst` or `-cd` flag, `maketree` then creates the destination directory if it doesn't exists.

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp/ --create-dst
```

Output:

```
3 directories and 8 files have been created.
```

<h3 id="handling-existing-files">Handling Existing Files</h3>

If you run `maketree` again in the same directory without deleting files, you‚Äôll see an error:

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp
```

Output:

```
Error: Found 8 existing files, cannot proceed. (try --skip or --overwrite)
```

By default, `maketree` does not **overwrite** or **skip** existing files.

<h4 id="overwrite-existing-files">Overwrite Existing Files</h4>

Use the `--overwrite` or `-o` flag to overwrite existing files:

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp --overwrite
```

Output:

```
0 directories and 8 files have been created.
```

<h4 id="skip-existing-files">Skip Existing Files</h4>

Use the `--skip` or `-s` flag to keep existing files but create missing ones:

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp --skip
```

Output: (After deleting 3 files)

```
0 directories and 3 files have been created.
```

<h3 id="extracting-the-structure">Extracting the Structure</h3>

You can also extract an already created project structure using `-et` or `--extract-tree` flag following the directory path of structure:

```sh
maketree --extract-tree myapp/
```

Output:

```
Tree has been extracted into 'myapp_1.tree'
```

Notice it created `myapp_1.tree`, because there was a `myapp.tree` already in the current directory.

Contents of `myapp_1.tree` file:

```
myapp/
    .gitignore
    package.json
    README.md
    node_modules/
    public/
        favicon.ico
        index.html
        robots.txt
    src/
        index.css
        index.js
```

Now this `.tree` file can be used whenever you want to create a similar project structure.

<h3 id="preview-the-structure">Preview the Structure</h3>

Use `--graphical` or `-g` to visualize the `myapp.tree` file:

```sh
maketree myapp.tree -g
```

Output:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ robots.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

It is also shown before you create a structure for confirmation.

<h3 id="avoid-confirming">Avoid Confirming:</h3>

By default, `maketree` confirms before creating the structure. But this can sometimes be anoyying. Use `--no-confirm` or `-nC` flag to create the structure without confirming. _(Notice the C is capital in `-nC`)_

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp --no-confirm
```

<h3 id="avoid-color-output">Avoid Color Output:</h3>

By default, `maketree` uses [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) to color the output.

```sh
maketree myapp.tree myapp/
```

If you're seeing something like this:

```sh
‚Üê[1m‚Üê[3m‚Üê[92msrc/‚Üê[0m
‚Üê[90m‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üê[0m ‚Üê[1m‚Üê[3m‚Üê[92mnode_modules/‚Üê[0m

‚Üê[90m‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üê[0m README.md
‚Üê[95mCreate this structure? (y/N): ‚Üê[0m
```

Then your terminal doesn't support **ANSI escape codes** by default. **(there are workarounds but they require extra python dependencies)**.

You will have to disable colors using `--no-color` or `-nc` flag.

```sh-session
maketree myapp.tree myapp/ --no-color
```

This will disable colors and you'll see normal text again.
