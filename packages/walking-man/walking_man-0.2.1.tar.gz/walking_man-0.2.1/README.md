This is Walking Man. He's a cute and entertaining animation for tasks that take time. An unsung hero who brings a bit of joy to operations that would otherwise be frustrating or tedious.

### Using Walking Man Responsibly

Walking Man is a special friend who brings joy to tedious waiting times. But like any good thing, moderation is key:

- Don't overuse him on every loading screen
- Let him appear unexpectedly to bring surprise and delight
- Save him for those moments when users really need a smile
- Remember: his rarity is part of his magic ✨

Walking Man is most effective when he shows up just when you've forgotten about him, making you smile exactly when you needed it most.

## Walking Man Adventure

Walking Man has finally broken free of his mundane existence as a [loading indicator](https://github.com/dannystewart/dsbase/blob/main/src/dsbase/animate/walking.py) and now he's ready to take on the world, or at least the vast 80 × 24 expanse of your terminal window.

It's the game we all wanted but didn't deserve. Until now.
