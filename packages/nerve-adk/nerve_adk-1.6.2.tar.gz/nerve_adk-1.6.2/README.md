Nerve is an ADK ( _Agent Development Kit_ ) designed to be a simple yet powerful platform for creating and executing LLM-based agents.

## Main Features

- Define agents as simple YAML files.
- Simple CLI for creating, installing, and running agents with step-by-step guidance.
- Comes with a library of predefined, built-in tools for common tasks.
- Easily integrate a vast amount of [MCP servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers), or create your own custom tools.
- Support for [any model provider](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

## Quick Start

```bash
# üñ•Ô∏è install the project with:
pip install nerve-adk

# ‚¨áÔ∏è download and install an agent from a github repo with:
nerve install evilsocket/changelog

# üí° or create an agent with a guided procedure:
nerve create new-agent

# üöÄ go!
nerve run new-agent
```

Agents are simple YAML files that can use a set of built-in tools such as a bash shell, file system primitives [and others](https://github.com/evilsocket/nerve/blob/main/docs/namespaces.md):

```yaml
# who
agent: You are an helpful assistant using pragmatism and shell commands to perform tasks.
# what
task: Find which running process is using more RAM.
# how
using: [shell]
```
