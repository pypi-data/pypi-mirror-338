## Usage

[See all examples here.](/examples)

### Example: H2O Machine Learning Agent

[See the full example here.](https://github.com/business-science/ai-data-science-team/blob/master/examples/ml_agents/h2o_machine_learning_agent.ipynb)

``` python
# Import libraries
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import pandas as pd
import h2o 
import os
from ai_data_science_team.ml_agents import H2OMLAgent

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("data/churn_data.csv")
df

# Initialize the language model
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
llm = ChatOpenAI(model=MODEL)
llm

# Initialize the H2O ML Agent
ml_agent = H2OMLAgent(
    model=llm, 
    log=True, 
    log_path="logs/",
    model_directory="h2o_models/", 
    enable_mlflow=True, # Use this if you wish to log models to MLflow 
)
ml_agent

# Run the agent
ml_agent.invoke_agent(
    data_raw=df.drop(columns=["customerID"]),
    user_instructions="Please do classification on 'Churn'. Use a max runtime of 30 seconds.",
    target_variable="Churn"
)

# Retrieve and display the leaderboard of models
ml_agent.get_leaderboard()
