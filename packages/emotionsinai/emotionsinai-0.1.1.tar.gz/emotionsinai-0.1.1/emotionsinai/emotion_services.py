        Updates the internal emotional state of the agent based on appraisal results using principles from
        psychological research and appraisal theory. The function takes into account the overall appraisal

        - self.internal_profile is an instance of InternalProfile.
        - self.internal_profile.emotional_profile["baseline_emotions"] is a dictionary with keys such as:

        The updating process works as follows:
        1. Overall appraisal is used to derive two types of adjustments:
            - A positive adjustment if the overall appraisal is above a neutral point (0.5),
            boosting positive emotions and reducing negative ones.
            - A negative adjustment if the appraisal is below the neutral point,
            increasing negative emotions. The impact is amplified by the agent's neuroticism.
        2. Novelty is also considered to modulate the 'surprise' emotion.
        3. The updated values are clamped between 0 and 1 to ensure valid emotion intensities.
