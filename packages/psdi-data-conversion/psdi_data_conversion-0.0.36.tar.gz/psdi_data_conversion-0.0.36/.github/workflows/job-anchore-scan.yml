# Reusable workflow intended to be called as a job by other workflows

# Runs a security scan of the project

# This file is a modified version of a workflow file provided by GitHub, namely
# the Security code-scanning workflow 'Anchore Grype Vulnerability Scan'.

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow checks out code, builds an image, performs a container image
# vulnerability scan with Anchore's Grype tool, and integrates the results with GitHub Advanced Security
# code scanning feature.  For more information on the Anchore scan action usage
# and parameters, see https://github.com/anchore/scan-action. For more
# information on Anchore's container image scanning tool Grype, see
# https://github.com/anchore/grype
