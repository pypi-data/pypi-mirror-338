# Reusable workflow intended to be called as a job by other workflows

# This action does the following:
#
# Creates a new release containing the repository source code, and tagging the
# release with an appropriate version number, and publishing it on the Github project
# page
#
# Notes:
# - The version number is incremented every release as described in
#   https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action. Note that by default semantic
#   version numbers are used and the patch number is incremented every release.
#   Moreover, in accordance with Angular conventional commits convention, the minor or
#   major number is incremented only upon detection of commits in the history with
#   certain formats. E.g. a commit beginning with 'feat:', signifying a new feature,
#   would result in the minor number being incremented. For details on the expected
#   format of commit messages in this regard see
#   https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular.
