### Python Executor Example

```python
import json
import os

from rich import print_json # not necessary, just for pretty printing

from arbiterx import CodeExecutor, Constraints


class PythonCodeExecutor(CodeExecutor):
    def get_compile_command(self, src: str) -> str:
        return ""

    def get_run_command(self, src: str) -> str:
        return f"python3 {src}/solution.py"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    constraints: Constraints = {
        "time_limit": 2,
        "memory_limit": 10,
        "memory_swap_limit": 0,  # No swap
        # cpu quota and period are in microseconds
        "cpu_quota": 1000000,
        "cpu_period": 1000000,
    }
    WORK_DIR = <submission_directory>
    with PythonCodeExecutor(
            user="sandbox", # Default is "nobody"
            docker_image="python312:v1",
            src=WORK_DIR,
            constraints=constraints,
            disable_compile=True,
    ) as executor:
        for result in executor.run():
            print_json(json.dumps(result), indent=4)
```

### C++ Executor Example

```python
import json

from rich import print_json
from arbiterx import CodeExecutor, Constraints


class CPPCodeExecutor(CodeExecutor):
    def get_compile_command(self, src: str) -> str:
        return f"g++ -o {src}/a.out {src}/main.cpp"

    def get_run_command(self, src: str) -> str:
        return f"{src}/a.out"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    constraints: Constraints = {
        "time_limit": 2,
        "memory_limit": 10,
        "memory_swap_limit": 0, 
        "cpu_quota": 1000000,
        "cpu_period": 1000000,
    }
    WORK_DIR = <submission_directory>
    with CPPCodeExecutor(
            user="sandbox",
            docker_image="cpp11:v1",
            src=WORK_DIR,
            constraints=constraints,
    ) as executor:
        for result in executor.run(shuffle=True):
            print_json(json.dumps(result), indent=4)

```

### Set log level
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
This will print the logs in the console.

### Possible verdicts
| Verdict | Label                     | Description |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
| AC      | Accepted                  | The program ran successfully and produced the correct output. |
| WA      | Wrong Answer               | The program ran successfully but produced incorrect output. |
| TLE     | Time Limit Exceeded        | The program took longer than the allowed execution time. |
| MLE     | Memory Limit Exceeded      | The program used more memory than the allowed limit. |

| OLE     | Output Limit Exceeded      | The program produced more output than the allowed limit. |
| CE      | Compilation Error          | The program failed to compile successfully. |
| ILE     | Idleness Limit Exceeded    | The program did not produce any output for too long, often indicating an infinite loop that does not consume CPU time. |
| JE      | Judgement Error            | The judgement process failed to produce a verdict. |

See the `arbiterx/verdicts.py` file for more details.

### Some useful parameters
- `disable_compile`: Disable compilation of the code. Useful when the code is already compiled or the code is in an interpreted language.
- `dry_run`: Pretty print the commands that will be executed.
```python
with PythonCodeExecutor(
        ...
        dry_run=True,
) as executor:
    for result in executor.run():
        ...
```

- `shuffle`: Randomly shuffle the test cases before running them.
```python
with CPPCodeExecutor(..) as executor:
    for result in executor.run(shuffle=True):
        ...
```
- `working_dir_in_container`: The working directory in the container. Default is `/sandbox`.
```python
with CPPCodeExecutor(
        ...
        working_dir_in_container="/sandbox",
) as executor:
    for result in executor.run():
        ...
```
- `early_exit`: Exit the loop as soon as a verdict is not `AC`.
```python
with CPPCodeExecutor(
        ...
) as executor:
    for result in executor.run(early_exit=True):
        ...
```

- `lazy_container`: Create container on the first run. Default is `False` which creates when the context manager is created.
```python
with CPPCodeExecutor(
        ...
        lazy_container=True,
) as executor:
    for result in executor.run():
        ...
```

- `cgroup_mount_path`: The path where the cgroup is mounted on host. Default is `/sys/fs/cgroup`.
This is used when bind mounting the cgroup to the container.
```python
with CPPCodeExecutor(
        ...
        cgroup_mount_path="/some/custom/path",
) as executor:
    for result in executor.run():
        ...
```
