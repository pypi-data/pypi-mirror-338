# Qaravan

**Qaravan** is a Python library for simulating quantum circuits with and without noise using a variety of classical simulation techniques. 

## Overview

Qaravan is organized into two main submodules

**tensorQ**: contains simulators based on tensor contraction: statevector, density matrix, matrix product states and matrix product density operators

**algebraQ**: contains simulators based on algebraic methods: Clifford, matchgate, Pauli path propagation and Lie algebraic simulation (in development)
