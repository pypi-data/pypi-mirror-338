# mn2: Mixed Models by Neural Networks

mn2 is software package to fit linear mixed models to experimental data. It
allows to maximize the restricted likelihood criteria and obtain estimatives of
fixed effects and variance components. Prediction of random effects parameters
and coefficients can be made over different structures of variance
covariance.
