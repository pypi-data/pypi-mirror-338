DataLab Simple Client User Guide
================================

DataLab is an **open-source platform for scientific and technical data processing
and visualization** with unique features designed to meet industrial requirements.
It is based on Python scientific libraries (such as NumPy, SciPy or scikit-image)
and Qt graphical user interfaces (thanks to `PlotPyStack`_).

    For more details, see DataLab `Website`_.

DataLab Simple Client (``cdlclient`` package) is a Python library providing a
remote proxy to a DataLab application (server). It allows to use DataLab
features from a remote computer, and/or from a third-party application.

It also provides widgets to embed DataLab features in a Qt application
(connection dialog, etc.). For this particular use case, the library relies
on `QtPy`_.

    DataLab is powered by `PlotPyStack <https://github.com/PlotPyStack>`_,
    the scientific Python-Qt visualization and graphical user interface stack.

.. note:: DataLab was created by `Codra`_/`Pierre Raybaut`_ in 2023. It is
          developed and maintained by DataLab open-source project.
