# AutoLRC

AutoLRC is a command-line that generates lyric files (.lrc) for your music locally using OpenAI's [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model.

## Installation

Install AutoLRC with pip

```bash
pip install auto-lrc
```

AutoLRC depends on [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed

## Usage

### CLI

```
AutoLRC --help
```

**Note:** the CLI may be slow to start as it has to import big packages.

- `--model`: Whisper model to use for transcription (default: `turbo`).
- `--device`: Device to run the transcription on (`cpu`, `cuda`, or default: `auto`).

### Example

AutoLRC --music-dir "M:\Music" --model "large-v3-turbo" --device "cuda"
```
