Performing tasks in many threads made fun!

This module facilitates distributing simple operations into jobs that are sent
to worker threads, maintained by a pool object.

It consists of these components:

   1. Jobs, which are single units of work that need to be performed.
   2. Workers, who grab jobs from a queue and perform them.
   3. Worker pool, which keeps track of workers and the job queue.
