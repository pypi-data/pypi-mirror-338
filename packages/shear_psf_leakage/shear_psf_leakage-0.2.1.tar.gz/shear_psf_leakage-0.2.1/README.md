# Shear PSF leakage

## About

This library quantifies the PSF leakage on weak-lensing galaxy shear            
measurements. It computes the following quantities:                             
                                                                                
- The object-wise PSF leakage at linear and quadratic order, using regression.  
- The object-wise dependency of galaxy shear to other (scalar) observables.     
- The scale-dependent PSF leakage function galaxy - PSF leakage using           
  two-point correlation functions. 

## Installation

The fastest way to Install this library is with `pip` automatically from
pypi.org,

```bash
pip install shear_psf_leakage
```

Alternatively, you can use TBD
