"""Download all data since the last contact from webpoda.

This script goes through and downloads all the newly arrived data from webpoda since
the last contact.

1. Iterate over each APID
2. Make a query to webpoda for ERTs between the last contact time and now.
3. Create a list of S/C dates with data from the last contact time.
   NOTE: This is not the same as the ERTs because there could be backfilled gaps.
4. Iterate over the S/C dates and download the binary data for each date.
5. Save the data to a local file
