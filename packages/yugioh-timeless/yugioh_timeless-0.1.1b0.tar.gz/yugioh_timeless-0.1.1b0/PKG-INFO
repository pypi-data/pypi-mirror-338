# Yu-Gi-Oh! TIMELESS

This repository provides a beginner-friendly command line tool for creating
pairings for a TIMELESS tournament.

> TIMELESS is a custom 4-player tournament format for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading
> Card Game. A TIMELESS tournament consists of four rounds. The three
> preliminary rounds, in which each duelist faces off against every other
> duelist, are followed up by a final play-off round. In each round, decks
> from a carefully constructed deck set of four are randomly assigned to the
> duelists. This is done in such a way that during the course of the tournament
> each duelist pilots each of the decks exactly once.


## Setup
(Requires Python 3.13 or newer.)
1. Install the *Yu-Gi-Oh! TIMELESS* package from PyPI:
~~~bash
pip install yugioh-timeless
~~~
2. The `timeless` command is now available in your shell. To create pairings,
   run it.
