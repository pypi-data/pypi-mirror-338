# Version constraints for pip installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# This file contains all common constraints for edx-repos

# Sphinx>5.3.0 requires docutils>=0.18,<0.20 but 
# sphinx_rtd_theme which needs docutils<0.18 
# which is causing make upgrade job to fail due to conflicts
# Constraint can be removed once sphinx_rtd_theme>=1.1.1 is available on PyPI
