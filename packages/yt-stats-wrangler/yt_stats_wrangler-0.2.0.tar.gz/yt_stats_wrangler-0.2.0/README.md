# yt-stats-wrangler

A flexible and easy-to-use Python package to collect and wrangle YouTube video and channel statistics using the **YouTube Data API v3**.

Built with extensibility and usability in mind, `yt-stats-wrangler` supports a range of outputs (raw JSON, pandas, polars) and offers features for analyzing video metadata, statistics, and comments.

You'll need a developer key for the YouTube API V3 to use this package. To generate an API key for your google developer account, please see the [official YouTube API v3 documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) for more information.

- Collect video statistics (views, likes, comments, etc.)
- Retrieve top-level comments from videos
- Output to multiple formats: `raw`, `pandas`, `polars`
- Flexible column formatting: `raw`, `lower_case`, `UPPER_CASE`, `mixedCase`
- Quota tracking support for efficient API usage
- Optional DataFrame utilities (reordering, parsing datetime)

## Installation

```bash
pip install yt-stats-wrangler
```

`yt-stats-wrangler` is designed to work independent of any data libraries in python for users who prefer a lightweight solution. `pandas`, `polars` are treated as optional dependencies. To use this package with those libraries, ensure they are installed in your enviornment or specify their installation like below:

To use with pandas:
```bash
pip install yt-stats-wrangler[pandas]
```

To use with polars:
```bash
pip install yt-stats-wrangler[polars]
```

## Quick Start

The following example is a quick start in gathering all videos present on the  [CDCodes YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cdcodes), and outputting the results into a pandas dataframe with formatted column names.

```python
from yt_stats_wrangler.api.client import YouTubeDataClient
import os

# Get your API key (recommended to store as environment variable)
api_key = os.getenv("YOUTUBE_API_V3_KEY")
client = YouTubeDataClient(api_key=api_key, max_quota=10000) # set to -1 for unlimited

# Get all videos from a channel
videos = client.get_all_video_details_for_channel(
    channel_id="UCB2mKxxXPK3X8SJkAc-db3A",
    key_format="upper",        # Format dictionary keys
    output_format="pandas"     # Output as pandas DataFrame
)

print(videos.head())
```
