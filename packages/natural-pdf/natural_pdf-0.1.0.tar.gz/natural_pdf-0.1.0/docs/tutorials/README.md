Welcome to the natural-pdf tutorials. These guides will walk you through the various features and capabilities of the library for working with PDF documents.

## Tutorial Series

### Beginner Tutorials
1. [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md) - Introduction to basic functionality
2. [Finding Elements](02-finding-elements.md) - How to find and work with document elements

### Intermediate Tutorials
3. [Working with Regions](07-working-with-regions.md) - Create and manipulate rectangular areas for targeted content extraction
4. [Spatial Navigation](08-spatial-navigation.md) - Navigate document elements relative to each other
5. [Section Extraction](09-section-extraction.md) - Extract document sections based on headings or separators
6. [Form Field Extraction](10-form-field-extraction.md) - Extract structured data from forms and documents

### Advanced Tutorials
7. [Enhanced Table Processing](11-enhanced-table-processing.md) - Advanced techniques for working with complex tables
8. [OCR Integration](12-ocr-integration.md) - Work with scanned documents using optical character recognition

## Using the Tutorials

Each tutorial is designed to be concise and practical, focusing on real-world use cases. The code examples:

- Use clean, straightforward Python
- Include visualizations to help you understand what's happening
- Show immediate results at the end of each code block
- Build on concepts from previous tutorials

## Sample PDFs

These tutorials use various PDF files located in the `pdfs/` directory:

- `01-practice.pdf` - A simple practice PDF used in basic tutorials
- `needs-ocr.pdf` - A scanned document for OCR examples
- `Atlanta_Public_Schools_GA_sample.pdf` - Contains structured records
- `2019 Statistics.pdf` - Contains statistical tables
- Other PDF samples for specific extraction scenarios

## Getting the Most from These Tutorials

1. **Run the Code**: Each tutorial contains executable code cells you can run in Jupyter notebooks.
2. **Visualize Elements**: Use the `.show()` function to see what elements are being detected.
3. **Try with Your Documents**: Adapt the examples to work with your own PDF documents.
4. **Combine Techniques**: The most powerful applications combine several techniques from different tutorials.
