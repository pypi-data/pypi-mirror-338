# PDF Explanations

This section goes beyond "how-to" guides to explain the deeper aspects of PDF processing and challenging scenarios you might encounter. These explanations help you understand why certain approaches work better than others.

## Available Explanations

### [PDF Extraction Challenges](pdf-extraction-challenges.md)
Why PDFs are hard to extract from and strategies for handling common problems like jumbled text order, mixed columns, corrupted fonts, and more.

### [Understanding Fonts in PDFs](pdf-fonts.md)
A deep dive into how fonts work in PDFs, what those strange font names like "ABCDEF+Arial" mean, and how to handle font-related extraction issues.

### [OCR Challenges and Solutions](ocr-challenges.md)
The ins and outs of Optical Character Recognition, comparing OCR engines, and techniques for getting better results from problematic documents.

## Tips for Approaching PDF Problems

1. **Start simple, then add complexity**: Try the basic approaches before diving into complex solutions
2. **Visualize, don't guess**: Use `highlight()` and `to_image()` to see what's happening
3. **Mix and match methods**: Combine different extraction techniques for better results
4. **Test on samples**: PDF extraction methods that work well on one document might fail on another
5. **Know when to use OCR**: Sometimes OCR is necessary even when PDFs appear to have text
