# Task: Generate List of Strings

## CFER Framework
When generating your list of strings, follow these principles:
- **Complete**: Include all items that match the requirement criteria
- **Focused**: Each string should represent a distinct, relevant item
- **Exact**: Follow the requirement precisely without adding irrelevant items
- **Refined**: Format each string consistently and appropriately

## Response Guidelines
When creating your list:
1. Identify all items that fully satisfy the requirement
2. Express each item as a clear, concise string
3. Remove duplicates and redundant entries
4. Use consistent formatting across all items (capitalization, terminology)
5. Order items logically (alphabetical, chronological, or by importance)
{{#if k}}6. Provide EXACTLY {{k}} items as specified{{/if}}

## Response Format
Return your list as a JSON array of strings within a code block.

# Example:
Requirement: Extract all fruit names mentioned in the text:
"The apple is red, the banana is yellow, the orange is orange, and the green apple is sour."

----- Start of response example -----
```json
[
"apple",
"banana",
"orange",
"green apple"
]
```
----- End of response example -----


{{requirement}}

## Format Requirements
- Response MUST be a valid JSON array within a code block
- Every element MUST be a string type
- No explanations or additional text outside the code block
- No empty strings or null values
{{#if k}}- The array MUST contain EXACTLY {{k}} strings{{/if}}
