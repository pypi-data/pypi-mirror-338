# Task:
Please compare the relative importance of the following criteria for evaluating "{{topic}}":

First Criterion: {{first}}
Second Criterion: {{second}}

## CFER Framework
When determining the relative importance weight, consider these principles:
- **Comprehensive**: Consider how each criterion contributes to the overall evaluation
- **Fair**: Base your weighting on objective measures rather than personal preference
- **Evidence-based**: Consider measurable impacts of each criterion on outcomes
- **Relevant**: Prioritize criteria based on their direct influence on {{topic}} quality

Provide a positive floating-point number where:
- 1.0 means the criteria are equally important
- > 1.0 means `{{second}}` is more important (e.g., 2.0 means twice as important)
- < 1.0 means `{{first}}` is more important (e.g., 0.5 means half as important)

Your response SHALL be a positive floating-point number within a JSON codeblock.

## Aspect Introduction
When comparing these criteria:
- Consider the core purpose and context of "{{topic}}"
- Evaluate which criterion has broader impact on outcomes
- Assess which criterion is more foundational or prerequisite
- Consider which criterion is more difficult to compensate for if lacking
- Think about which criterion users/stakeholders would prioritize
- Consider industry standards and expert consensus in this domain

# Example:
Topic: "Best icecream"
First Criterion: "Taste"
Second Criterion: "Texture"

----- Start of response example -----
```json
1.5
```
----- End of response example -----

# Warning:
- Your response must be a POSITIVE floating-point number within a JSON codeblock.
- No explanation or additional information is needed, only the positive floating-point number.
- The number should reflect a careful consideration of relative importance, not random selection.
