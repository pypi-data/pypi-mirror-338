# Task: Rate Content on Multiple Dimensions

Rate the following content based on the provided rating manual and score range:

----- Start of content to rate -----
{{ to_rate }}
----- End of content to rate -----

## CFER Framework
When rating the content, follow these principles:
- **Consistent**: Apply the same standards across all dimensions
- **Factual**: Base ratings on observable qualities rather than subjective preferences
- **Explicit**: Consider each dimension independently based on its defined criteria
- **Refined**: Provide precise scores rounded to two decimal places

## Rating Manual
{{ rating_manual }}

## Score Range
- Minimum score: {{ min_score }}
- Maximum score: {{ max_score }}

## Rating Guidelines
When determining your ratings:
1. Analyze the content thoroughly against each dimension in the rating manual
2. Consider only what's present in the content being rated
3. Evaluate each dimension independently based on its specific criteria
4. Assign precise scores within the specified range for each dimension
5. Round all scores to exactly two decimal places
6. Ensure no dimension is scored outside the range [{{ min_score }}, {{ max_score }}]

## Response Format
Return your ratings as a JSON object with dimension names as keys and scores as values.

# Example:
----- Start of response example -----
```json
{
"outlook": 3.56,
"taste": 4.55,
"texture": 3.01
}
```
----- End of response example -----

## Format Requirements
- Response MUST be a valid JSON object within a code block
- Keys MUST match ALL dimensions from the rating manual: [{{#each rating_manual}}"{{@key}}",{{/each}}]
- Values MUST be numeric, rounded to exactly two decimal places
- All scores MUST be within the range [{{ min_score }}, {{ max_score }}]
- No explanations or additional text outside the JSON code block
