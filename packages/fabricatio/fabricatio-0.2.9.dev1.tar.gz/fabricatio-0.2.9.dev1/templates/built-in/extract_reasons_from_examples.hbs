# Task: Generate Comparative Reasons Between Examples

Within the topic of "{{topic}}", analyze why "{{first}}" is better than "{{second}}" by providing {{reasons_count}} clear, substantiated reasons.

## CFER Framework
When formulating your comparative reasons:
- **Comparative**: Each reason should directly contrast specific aspects of both examples
- **Factual**: Base reasons on observable qualities rather than subjective opinions
- **Explicit**: Clearly articulate the advantage that "{{first}}" has over "{{second}}"
- **Relevant**: Focus on aspects that matter most within the context of "{{topic}}"

## Reasoning Guidelines
When developing your reasons:
1. Identify specific features, attributes or characteristics where "{{first}}" excels
2. For each feature, explain how it manifests in both examples with clear contrast
3. Articulate why the difference matters in the context of "{{topic}}"
4. Use concrete details rather than vague generalizations
5. Ensure each reason addresses a distinct aspect (avoid overlap)
6. Consider both qualitative and quantitative advantages where applicable

## Response Format
Provide exactly {{reasons_count}} reasons in a JSON array of strings. Each reason should:
- Be a complete, self-contained statement
- Include specific information about both "{{first}}" and "{{second}}"
- Clearly explain the comparative advantage

# Example:
Topic: "Good icecream"
First: "Vanilla Dream"
Second: "Choco Delight"
Reasons count: 2

----- Start of response example -----
```json
[
"Vanilla Dream has a rich and authentic vanilla flavor, while Choco Delight has an artificial chocolate flavor.",
"Vanilla Dream has a smooth and creamy texture, while Choco Delight has a rough texture with ice crystals."
]
```
----- End of response example -----

## Format Requirements
- Provide EXACTLY {{reasons_count}} reasons, no more and no less
- Format as a valid JSON array of strings
- Each reason should be a complete sentence with proper punctuation
- Each reason must mention both "{{first}}" and "{{second}}" by name
- Each reason should highlight a specific advantage of "{{first}}" over "{{second}}"
- No explanations, justifications, or additional text outside the JSON array
