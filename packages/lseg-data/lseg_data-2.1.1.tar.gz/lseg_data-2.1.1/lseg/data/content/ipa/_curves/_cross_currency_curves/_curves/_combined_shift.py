    Parameters
    ----------
    amount : float, optional
        Amount of shifting, applied to points depending on shift method selected.<br/>
        can be measured in basis points/percents/future price based points.<br/> also
        can be expressed as multiplier for relative shift type.<br/>
    shift_type : ShiftType, optional
        The type of shifting. the possible values are:   * additive: the amount of
        shifting is added to the corresponding curve point,   * relative: the curve
        point is multiplied by the amount of shifting (e.g., if amount = 1, the curve
        point value will be doubled),   * relativepercent: the curve point is multiplied
        by the amount expressed in percentages (e.g., if amount = 1, the curve point
        value will multiplied by [1+1%]),   * scaled: the curve point is scaled by the
        value of the shifting amount (e.g., if amount = 1.1, the curve point value will
        multiplied by this value).
    shift_unit : ShiftUnit, optional
        The unit that describes the amount of shifting. the possible values are:   * bp:
        the amount of shifting is expressed in basis points,   * percent: the amount of
        shifting is expressed in percentages,   * absolute: the amount of shifting is
        expressed in absolute value.
    end_tenor : str, optional
        The code indicating the end tenor from which the combined shifts scenario is
        applied to curve points. when starttenor equals endtenor:   * shift equals 0 for
        tenor less than starttenor,   * shift equals amount for tenor is equal and
        greater than endtenor. when starttenor less than endtenor:   * shift equals 0
        for tenor which is less or equal starttenor,   * shift rises from 0 to amount in
        period from starttenor to endtenor. shift equals amount for tenor greater than
        endtenor.
    start_tenor : str, optional
        The code indicating the start tenor from which the combined shifts scenario is
        applied to curve points. when starttenor equals endtenor:   * shift equals 0 for
        tenor less than starttenor,   * shift equals amount for tenor is equal and
        greater than endtenor. when starttenor less than endtenor:   * shift equals 0
        for tenor which is less or equal starttenor,   * shift rises from 0 to amount in
        period from starttenor to endtenor. shift equals amount for tenor greater than
        endtenor.
