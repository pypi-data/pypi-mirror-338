    Parameters
    ----------
    max_of_median_implied_vol_percent : float, optional
        The value can be used to exclude strikes with implied volatilities larger
        than upper bound. The upper bound is computed as MaxOfMedianImpliedVolPercent
        multiplied by median implied volatility and divided by 100. The value is
        expressed in percentages.
        Mandatory if strikeRange object is used.
    min_of_median_implied_vol_percent : float, optional
        The value can be used to exclude strikes with implied volatilities less than
        lower bound. The lower bound is computed as MinOfMedianImpliedVolPercent
        multiplied by median implied volatility and divided by 100.
        The value is expressed in percentages.
