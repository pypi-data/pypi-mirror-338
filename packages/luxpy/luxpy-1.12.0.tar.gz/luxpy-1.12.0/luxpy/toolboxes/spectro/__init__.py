"""
Package for spectral measurements
=================================

Supported devices:
------------------

 * JETI: specbos 1211, etc.
 * OceanOptics: QEPro, QE65Pro, QE65000, USB2000, USB650,etc.
 
 :get_spd(): wrapper function to measure a spectral power distribution using a spectrometer of one of the supported manufacturers. 
 
Notes
-----
 1. For info on the input arguments of get_spd(), see help for each identically named function in each of the subpackages. 
 2. The use of jeti spectrometers requires access to some dll files (delivered with this package).
 3. The use of oceanoptics spectrometers requires the manual installation of pyseabreeze, as well as some other 'manual' settings. See help for oceanoptics sub-package.
