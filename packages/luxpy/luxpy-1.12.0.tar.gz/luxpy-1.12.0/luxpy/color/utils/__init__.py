"""
Module with functions related to plotting of color data
=======================================================

 :get_cmap(): Get an ndarray of rgb values representing a linearly sampled matplotlib colormap

 :get_subplot_layout(): Calculate layout of multiple subplots.

 :plot_color_data(): Plot color data (local helper function)

 :plotDL(): Plot daylight locus. 

 :plotBB(): Plot blackbody locus. 

 :plotSL(): | Plot spectrum locus.  
            | (plotBB() and plotDL() are also called, but can be turned off).

 :plotcerulean(): | Plot cerulean (yellow (577 nm) - blue (472 nm)) line 
                  | (Kuehni, CRA, 2014: Table II: spectral lights)
                  | `Kuehni, R. G. (2014). 
                    Unique hues and their stimuli—state of the art. 
                    Color Research & Application, 39(3), 279–287.
                    <https://doi.org/10.1002/col.21793>`_

 :plotUH(): | Plot unique hue lines from color space center point xyz0.
