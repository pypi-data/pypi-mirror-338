# luxpy.spectro.oceanoptics: module for spectral measurements using OceanOptics spectrometers 


## Installation:

 1. Install oceanoptics drivers (OMNISPAM or OCEANVIEW / SPECTRASUITE software, etc.)
 2. Install python API for seabreeze: conda install -c conda-forge seabreeze
 3. Ready to go!
    
## Functions:
 * dvc_open(): initialize spectrometer
 * get_spd(): measure spectrum
 * create_dark_model(): create a model for dark counts
 * estimate_dark_from_model(): estimate dark counts for specified integration time based on model
 * get_temperature(): Get temperature of ocean optics devive (if tec supported; returns NaN if not).
 * set_temperature(): Set temperature of ocean optics devive (if tec supported).
 
## Default parameters:
 * _INT_TIME_SEC: int, default integration time
 * _CORRECT_DARK_COUNTS: bool, automatic dark count correction supported by some spectrometers
 * _CORRECT_NONLINEARITY: bool, automatic non-linearity correction
 * _TARGET_MAX_CNTS_RATIO: float, aim for e.g. 80% (0.8) of max number of counts
 * _IT_RATIO_INCREASE: float, first stage of int_time optimization: increase int_time by this fraction
 * _MAX_NUMBER_OF_RATIO_INCREASES: int, number of times to apply ration increase before estimating using lin. regr.
 * _DARK_MODEL_INT_TIMES: ndarray, e.g. np.linspace(1e-6, 7.5, 5): array with integration times for dark model
 * _SAVGOL_WINDOW: window for smoothing of dark measurements
 * _SAVGOL_ORDER: order of savgol filter
 * _VERBOSITY: (0: nothing, 1: text, 2: text + graphs)
 * _DARK_MODEL: path and file where default dark_model is stored.
 * _ERROR: error value.
 * _TEMPC: default value of temperature (Â°C) to cool TEC supporting devices.
    
## Notes:
 1. More info on: https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze
    
 2. Due to the way ocean optics firmware/drivers are implemented, 
 most spectrometers do not support an abort mode of the standard 'free running mode', 
 which causes spectra to be continuously stored in a FIFO array. 
 This first-in-first-out (FIFO) causes a very unpractical behavior of the spectrometers,
 such that, to ensure one gets a spectrum corresponding to the latest integration time 
 sent to the device, one is forced to call the spec.intensities() function twice! 
 This means a simple measurements now takes twice as long, resulting in a sub-optimal efficiency. 

 3. Hopefully, Ocean Optics will at some point implement a more simple and 
 more logical operation of their devices: one that just reads a spectrum 
 at the desired integration time the momemt the function is called and which puts the 
 spectrometer in idle mode when no spectrum is requested.

 4. When using pyseabreeze backend: change read_eeprom_slot() in eeprom.py in **pyseabreeze** because the 
 ubs output used ',' as decimal separator instead of '.' (probably because
 of the use of a french keyboard, despite having system set to use '.' as separator):  
 line 20 in eeprom.py: "return data.rstrip('\x00')" was changed to
 "return data.rstrip('\x00').replace(',','.')"
