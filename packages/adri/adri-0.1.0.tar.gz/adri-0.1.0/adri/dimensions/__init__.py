"""
Dimension assessors for the Agent Data Readiness Index.

This package contains the assessors for each of the five ADRI dimensions:
- Validity: Whether data adheres to required types, formats, and ranges
- Completeness: Whether all expected data is present
- Freshness: Whether data is current enough for the decision
- Consistency: Whether data elements maintain logical relationships
- Plausibility: Whether data values are reasonable based on context
