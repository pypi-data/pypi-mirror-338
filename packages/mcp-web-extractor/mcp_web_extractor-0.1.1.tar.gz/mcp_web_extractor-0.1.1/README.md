# Web Extractor

An MCP server that allows Claude and other LLMs to extract and read content from web pages.

## Why Use Web Extractor?

- **Enable Web Access**: Let LLMs read content from websites even in regions where direct web browsing isn't available
- **Clean Content**: Extract only the main content, removing scripts, ads, and other distractions
- **Simple Integration**: Works with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

## Installation

```bash
pip install web-extractor
