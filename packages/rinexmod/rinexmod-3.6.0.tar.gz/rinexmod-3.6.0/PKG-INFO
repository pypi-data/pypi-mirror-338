rinexmod is a tool to batch modify the headers of GNSS data files in RINEX format, as well as to rename them correctly.
It supports Hatakana-compressed and non-compressed files, RINEX versions 2 and 3, as well as short and long naming conventions.
It is developed in python3, and can be run from the command line or directly in API mode by calling a python function.
The required input metadata can come from a sitelogs file, or be manually entered as arguments to the command line or the called function.
It is available under the GNU license on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/IPGP/rinexmod
