    Hello, World! üåç‚ú®

    This is a test document with special characters:

    - Bullet points:
    - ‚úì Checkmark
    - ‚úó Cross
    - ‚Üí Arrow

    1. Numbers with symbols:
    - 1Ô∏è‚É£ First
    - 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second
    - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third

    üí° Tips:  
        - Use `Ctrl + C` to copy.  
        - Use `Ctrl + V` to paste.  

    Mathematical symbols:  
        ‚àë (Summation), ‚à´ (Integral), ‚àö (Square root), œÄ (Pi)

    Line break example:  
    First line...  
    Second line...  

    Tab example:  
    \tTabbed text starts here.

    Quotes:  
    "To be, or not to be, that is the question." ‚Äî *William Shakespeare*

    End of sample.  
    Thank you! üôè
