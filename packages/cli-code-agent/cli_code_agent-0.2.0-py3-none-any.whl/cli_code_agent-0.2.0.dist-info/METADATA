# CLI Code

[![Python CI](https://github.com/BlueCentre/cli-code/actions/workflows/python-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BlueCentre/cli-code/actions/workflows/python-ci.yml)

A powerful AI coding assistant for your terminal, powered by multiple LLM providers (starting with Gemini).

More information [here](https://blossom-tarsier-434.notion.site/Gemini-Code-1c6c13716ff180db86a0c7f4b2da13ab?pvs=4)

## Features

- Interactive chat sessions in your terminal
- Multiple model provider support (Google Gemini, Ollama - more planned)
- Configurable default provider and model
- Hierarchical context initialization from:
  - `.rules/*.md` files (if directory exists)
  - `README.md` file (fallback)
  - Directory listing (final fallback)
- Basic history management (prevents excessive length)
- Markdown rendering in the terminal
- Automatic tool usage by the assistant:
  - File operations (view, edit, list, grep, glob)
  - Directory operations (ls, tree, create_directory)
  - System commands (bash)
  - Quality checks (linting, formatting)
  - Test running capabilities (pytest, etc.)

## Installation

### Method 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install directly from PyPI
pip install cli-code-agent
```

### Method 2: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BlueCentre/cli-code.git
cd cli-code

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Setup

Before using CLI Code, you need to set up API credentials for your desired provider:

```bash
# Set up Google API key for Gemini models
cli-code-agent setup --provider=gemini YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY

# OR Set up Ollama endpoint URL (if running Ollama locally or elsewhere)
# cli-code-agent setup --provider=ollama YOUR_OLLAMA_API_URL
```

### Alternative Setup Using Environment Variables

You can also configure CLI Code using environment variables, either by setting them directly or using a `.env` file:

1. Create a `.env` file in your working directory (copy from `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and uncomment/modify the settings you need:
   ```
   # API Keys and URLs
   CLI_CODE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   CLI_CODE_OLLAMA_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
   
   # Default Provider
   CLI_CODE_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=ollama
   
   # Default Model
   CLI_CODE_OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL=llama3.2:latest
   ```

3. Run CLI Code normally, and it will automatically load the settings from your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cli-code-agent
   ```

The environment variables take precedence over saved configuration, making this approach useful for temporary settings or project-specific configurations.

## Usage

```bash
# Start an interactive session with the default provider/model
cli-code-agent

# Start a session with a specific provider (uses provider's default model)
cli-code-agent --provider=ollama

# Start a session with a specific provider and model
cli-code-agent --provider=ollama --model llama3

# Start a session with Gemini and a specific model
cli-code-agent --provider=gemini --model models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest

# Set default provider and model (example)
# cli-code-agent set-default-provider ollama
# cli-code-agent set-default-model llama3

# List available models for a specific provider
cli-code-agent list-models --provider=gemini
cli-code-agent list-models --provider=ollama
```

## Interactive Commands

During an interactive session, you can use these commands:

- `/exit` - Exit the chat session
- `/help` - Display help information

## How It Works

### Tool Usage

Unlike direct command-line tools, the CLI Code assistant uses tools automatically to help answer your questions. For example:

1. You ask: "What files are in the current directory?"
2. The assistant (using the configured LLM provider) determines the `ls` tool is needed.
3. The assistant calls the `ls` tool function.
4. The tool executes locally and returns the results.
5. The assistant formulates a response based on the tool results and its LLM capabilities.

This approach makes the interaction more natural.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Context with `.rules`

CLI Code now supports a hierarchical approach to initializing context, allowing you to customize what information the assistant has access to at the start of each session:

1. Create a `.rules` directory in your project
2. Add Markdown (`.md`) files with project guidelines, structure, and conventions
3. The assistant will use these files as initial context instead of directory listings

For detailed instructions and best practices, see [Context Rules Documentation](docs/context_rules.md).

## Development

This project uses Ruff for linting and formatting. Configuration is managed in the `.ruff.toml` file. Please ensure your contributions adhere to the defined style.

```bash
# Check linting
ruff check .

# Apply formatting
ruff format .
```

This project is under active development.

### Recent Changes in v0.1.69

- Added hierarchical context management with support for `.rules/*.md` files and README.md
- Added test_runner tool to execute automated tests (e.g., pytest)
- Fixed syntax issues in the tool definitions
- Improved error handling in tool execution
- Updated status displays during tool execution with more informative messages
- Added additional utility tools (directory_tools, quality_tools, task_complete_tool, summarizer_tool)

### Recent Changes in v0.1.21

- Implemented native Gemini function calling for much more reliable tool usage
- Rewritten the tool execution system to use Gemini's built-in function calling capability
- Enhanced the edit tool to better handle file creation and content updating
- Updated system prompt to encourage function calls instead of text-based tool usage
- Fixed issues with Gemini not actively creating or modifying files
- Simplified the BaseTool interface to support both legacy and function call modes

### Recent Changes in v0.1.20

- Fixed error with Flask version check in example code
- Improved error handling in system prompt example code

### Recent Changes in v0.1.19

- Improved system prompt to encourage more active tool usage
- Added thinking/planning phase to help Gemini reason about solutions
- Enhanced response format to prioritize creating and modifying files over printing code
- Filtered out thinking stages from final output to keep responses clean
- Made Gemini more proactive as a coding partner, not just an advisor

### Recent Changes in v0.1.18

- Updated default model to Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (models/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25)
- Updated system prompts to reference Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Improved model usage and documentation

### Recent Changes in v0.1.17

- Added `list-models` command to show all available Gemini models
- Improved error handling for models that don't exist or require permission
- Added model initialization test to verify model availability
- Updated help documentation with new commands

### Recent Changes in v0.1.16

- Fixed file creation issues: The CLI now properly handles creating files with content
- Enhanced tool pattern matching: Added support for more formats that Gemini might use
- Improved edit tool handling: Better handling of missing arguments when creating files
- Added special case for natural language edit commands (e.g., "edit filename with content: ...")

### Recent Changes in v0.1.15

- Fixed tool execution issues: The CLI now properly processes tool calls and executes Bash commands correctly
- Fixed argument parsing for Bash tool: Commands are now passed as a single argument to avoid parsing issues
- Improved error handling in tools: Better handling of failures and timeouts
- Updated model name throughout the codebase to use `gemini-1.5-pro` consistently

### Known Issues

- Configuration path changed from `~/.config/gemini-code` to `~/.config/cli-code`. You will need to run `cli-code-agent setup --provider=gemini YOUR_KEY` again after updating.
