Tutorials
---------

The following tutorials contain the workflow and code to simulate and visualize commonly
studied M/EEG signals including event related potentials and low frequency rhythms in the
alpha, beta and gamma bands. The tutorial workflows, and all parameter values used,
are based on the detailed tutorials provided on the `HNN GUI website
<https://hnn.brown.edu/tutorials>`_, and reproduce a subset of examples and figures in the
more elaborated GUI tutorials using the HNN-core API.

We strongly recommend that you
first go through the background information provided on the `HNN website
<https://hnn.brown.edu/overview-uniqueness/>`_ and each of the HNN GUI tutorials,
after which the code and instructions in these HNN-core tutorials will be clearer.
All tutorials build from our prior publications investigating the origin of ERPs and
brain rhythms in the somatosensory system, and parameter and data sets are provided to
help users get started.
