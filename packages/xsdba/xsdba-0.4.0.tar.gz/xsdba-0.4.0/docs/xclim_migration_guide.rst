xclim Migration Guide
=====================

`xsdba` was first developed as a submodule of `xclim`_. The reasons for this split were primarily:

* `xclim.sdba` grew significantly to become a fully-featured submodule within `xclim` with a different aim;
* Expansion of `xclim.sdba` was constrained by the need to not significantly break existing `xclim` features;
* And to increase collaboration with other consortiums, we want more flexibility (i.e. this will break more often).

For `xclim` users, it will still be possible to import `sdba` if `xsdba` is installed.

.. code-block:: python

    from xclim import sdba

Internally, `xclim` simply imports `xsdba` as `sdba`, so there is no different between an import within `xclim` or a direct import of `xsdba`.

.. note::

    This behaviour in `xclim` may change in the future.


Units handling
--------------

One important change concerns units handling. Conversion between units with different dimensionality was previously automated, when possible, in `xclim.sdba`, given that the target dataset had a suitable standard name (e.g. allowing conversion of `lwe_precipitation_rate` from `kg m-2 s-1` to `mm d-1`). `xsdba` does not perform these automatic conversions, thus the datasets and thresholds to be compared should be given in units that share the same dimensionality before being passed to `xsdba` functions.

`xsdba` still implements some unit handling through `pint`. High-level adjustment objects will (usually) parse units from the passed `xarray` objects (`Dataset`/`DataArray`), check that the different inputs have matching units and perform conversions when units are compatible but don not match. `xsdba` imports the `cf-xarray unit registry`_ by default and, as such, expects units matching the definitions found in the `CF Conventions Units section`_. This is very similar to `xclim`, except for two features:

    - `xclim` is able to detect more complex conversions based on the CF "standard name". `xsdba` will not implement this, the user is expected to provide coherent inputs to the adjustment objects.
    - `xclim` has a convenience "hydro" context that allows for conversion between rates and fluxes, thicknesses and amounts of liquid water quantities by using an implicit the water density (1000 kg/mÂ³).

The context of that last point can still be used if `xclim` is imported along with `xsdba`:

.. code-block:: python

    import xsdba
    import xclim  # importing xclim makes xsdba use xclim's unit registry

    pr_ref  # reference precipitation data in kg m-2 s-1
    pr_hist  # historical precipitation data in mm/d
    # In normal xsdba, the two quantities are not compatible.
    # But with xclim's hydro context, an implicit density allows for conversion

    with xclim.core.units.units.context("hydro"):
        QDM = xsdba.QuantileDeltaMapping.train(
            ref=pr_ref,
            hist=pr_hist,
            adapt_freq_thresh="0.1 mm/d",
            jitter_under_thresh_value="0.01 mm/d",
        )
        pr_adj = QM.adjust(sim=pr_sim)

Under the hood, `xsdba` picks whichever unit registry has been declared the "application registry" (see the `pint registry documentation`_). However, it expects some features as declared in `cf-xarray`, so a compatible registry (such as `xclim`'s) must be used.

xsdba global options
--------------------

It used to be possible to control certain global functionalities of `sdba` with `xclim` global options. `SDBA_ENCODE_CF` was
removed as it was not necessary. The option `SDBA_EXTRA_OUTPUT` is now simply called `EXTRA_OUTPUT` within `xsdba`
and can be activated in two ways, either from `xclim`, or directly from `xsdba`

.. code-block:: python

    import xsdba

    with xsdba.set_options(extra_output=True):
        adj = xsdba.MBCn.train(...)

    # or, using the legacy way of importing
    from xclim import sdba

    with sdba.set_options(extra_output=True):
        adj = sdba.MBCn.train(...)
