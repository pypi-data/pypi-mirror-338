## Introduction

`brickalize` provides tools to take a standard 3D model file (STL) and transform it into a representation made of LEGO-like bricks. It voxelizes the input model, optionally extracts its shell to make it hollow, intelligently places bricks from a user-defined set to build the structure, generates sparse support pillars for overhangs, and offers visualization options including interactive 3D rendering and 2D build instruction images.

This package is useful for hobbyists, LEGO® engineers, or anyone interested in translating digital 3D designs into physically buildable brick models.

## Features

*   **STL Loading:** Loads 3D models from STL files using `trimesh`.
*   **Voxelization:** Converts continuous 3D models into a grid of voxels with configurable resolution, direction, and aspect ratio. Supports fast (center-point) and more accurate (multi-point threshold) voxel occupancy checks.
*   **Shell Extraction:** Option to keep only the outer shell of the voxelized model, creating hollow structures.
*   **Brick Definition:** Define available brick types (dimensions, support status) using the `Brick` class and manage them with `BrickSet`.
*   **Intelligent Brick Placement:** An algorithm (`Brickalizer.array_to_brick_model`) converts the voxel grid into a `BrickModel` by placing bricks from the provided `BrickSet`, optimizing for larger bricks where possible.
*   **Automatic Support Generation:** Generates sparse, pillar-like support structures (`Brickalizer.generate_support`) necessary for overhangs, minimizing material usage compared to dense supports.
*   **Model Representation:** Stores the final structure layer by layer in a `BrickModel` object.
*   **3D Visualization:** Renders the `BrickModel` (including separate colors/transparency for support) in an interactive 3D view using `open3d`.
*   **Mesh Saving:** Saves the generated brick model (including supports) as a single STL file.
*   **2D Layer Images:** Generates detailed 2D images for each layer, suitable for building instructions, with customizable colors, stud overlays, and ghost layer previews.

## Installation

**1. Using pip (Recommended):**

```bash
pip install brickalize
```

**2. Installing from Source (GitHub):**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CreativeMindstorms/brickalize.git
```

This will also install the required dependencies.

## Usage

### Core Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow using `brickalize`:

```python
# examples/basic_usage.py
from brickalize import (
    Brick,
    BrickSet,
    BrickModel, # Import BrickModel if needed directly in example
    BrickModelVisualizer,
    Brickalizer
)
import numpy as np

# Initialize variables
stl_file = 'model.stl'
output_dir = 'images'
grid_voxel_count = 20
grid_direction = "z"
brick_set = BrickSet([Brick(1, 2), Brick(1, 4), Brick(2, 2), Brick(1, 1), Brick(1, 3), Brick(2, 4), Brick(1, 6), Brick(1, 1, True), Brick(1, 2, True)])

# Voxelize the model
brick_array = Brickalizer.voxelize_stl(stl_file, grid_voxel_count, grid_direction, fast_mode=True)

# Only keep the shell of the model, making it hollow
boundary_array = Brickalizer.extract_shell_from_3d_array(brick_array)

# Convert to a brickmodel
brick_model = Brickalizer.array_to_brick_model(boundary_array, brick_set)

# Generate support
support_array = Brickalizer.generate_support(brick_model, boundary_array)

# Add support to the brick model
brick_model = Brickalizer.array_to_brick_model(support_array, brick_set, brick_model, is_support=True)

# Check if all voxels that should be occupied are occupied
test_array = Brickalizer.brick_model_to_array(brick_model)
assert np.array_equal(boundary_array, test_array), "The original and converted arrays are not the same!"

# Normalize the brick model to ensure it starts at (0,0,0)
# Can be helpful in situations where the brick_model is used in a different program
brick_model.normalize()

# Create a 3D mesh
mesh_list = BrickModelVisualizer.draw_model(brick_array, support_array) # Optimized for only visible faces

# Create a 3D mesh for each brick
mesh_brick_list = BrickModelVisualizer.draw_model_individual_bricks(brick_model) # Non-optimized, drawing all faces

# Save the model as mesh or images of each layer
BrickModelVisualizer.save_model(mesh_list, file_path="brick_model.stl")
import os
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
BrickModelVisualizer.save_as_images(brick_model, dir_path=output_dir)

# Visualize/show the model
BrickModelVisualizer.show_model(mesh_list)
```

### Key Components

*   **`Brick(d1, d2, is_support=False)`:** Defines a single type of brick. `d1` and `d2` are stud dimensions (e.g., 2x4), `is_support` flags it as a support-only brick.
*   **`BrickSet([Brick(...), ...])`:** Holds a collection of unique `Brick` objects available for the conversion process.
*   **`Brickalizer`:** Contains the static methods for the main conversion steps:
    *   `voxelize_stl()`: STL to 3D numpy array.
    *   `extract_shell_from_3d_array()`: Make the voxel array hollow.
    *   `array_to_brick_model()`: Voxel array to `BrickModel` using a `BrickSet`.
    *   `generate_support()`: Creates a 3D numpy array indicating needed support voxels.
    *   `brick_model_to_array()`: Converts a `BrickModel` back to a 3D numpy array.
*   **`BrickModel`:** Represents the final structure as a dictionary of layers, where each layer contains a list of placed bricks (position, size, support status).
*   **`BrickModelVisualizer`:** Static methods for visualization and saving:
    *   `draw_model()`: Creates `open3d` mesh geometry from voxel/support arrays (efficient).
    *   `draw_model_individual_bricks()`: Creates `open3d` mesh geometry with one mesh per brick (detailed but slower).
    *   `show_model()`: Displays the generated meshes in an interactive window.
    *   `save_model()`: Saves the mesh geometry as an STL file.
    *   `save_as_images()`: Generates 2D PNG images for each layer.
