class ContinuousCoveragePhenotype(Phenotype):
    """
    ContinuousCoveragePhenotype identifies patients based on duration of observation data. ContinuousCoveragePhenotype requires an anchor phenotype, typically the entry criterion. It then identifies an observation time period that contains the anchor phenotype. The phenotype can then be used to identify patients with a user specified continuous coverage before or after the anchor phenotype.

    There are two primary use cases for ContinuousCoveragePhenotype:
        1. Identify patients with some minimum duration of coverage prior to anchor_phenotype date e.g. "identify patients with 1 year of continuous coverage prior to index date"
        2. Determine the date of loss to followup (right censoring) i.e. the duration of coverage after the anchor_phenotype event

    ## Data for ContinuousCoveragePhenotype
    This phenotype requires a table with PersonID and a coverage start date and end date. Depending on the datasource used, this information is a separate ObservationPeriod table or found in the PersonTable. Use an PhenexObservationPeriodTable to map required coverage start and end date columns.

    | PersonID    |   coverageStartDate  |   coverageEndDate  |
    |-------------|----------------------|--------------------|
    | 1           |   2009-01-01         |   2010-01-01       |
    | 2           |   2008-01-01         |   2010-01-02       |

    One assumption that is made by ContinuousCoveragePhenotype is that there are **NO overlapping coverage periods**.

            min_days: The minimum number of days of continuous coverage. The operator must be '>=' or '>'.

            when: 'before', 'after'. If before, the return date is the start of the coverage period containing the anchor_phenotype. If after, the return date is the end of the coverage period containing the anchor_phenotype.
