## Grafana Dashboard

This project includes a pre-configured Grafana dashboard to visualize the exported metrics. You can find the dashboard definition in `grafana/dashboard.json`.

To import the dashboard into your Grafana instance:

1.  Navigate to your Grafana UI.
2.  Go to `Dashboards` -> `Browse`.
3.  Click the `Import` button (usually in the top right).
4.  Click `Upload JSON file` and select the `grafana/dashboard.json` file from this repository.
5.  Alternatively, you can paste the JSON content directly into the text area.
6.  Configure the dashboard options, such as selecting your Prometheus data source.
7.  Click `Import`.

This dashboard provides panels for visualizing active tasks, completion trends, task breakdowns by project/priority/label, and exporter health metrics.

## Configuration

The exporter can be configured using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` | Todoist API token (required) | - |
| `EXPORTER_PORT` | Port for the HTTP server | 9090 |
| `METRICS_PATH` | HTTP path for metrics | /metrics |
| `COLLECTION_INTERVAL` | Seconds between metric collections | 60 |
| `COMPLETED_TASKS_DAYS` | Number of days to look back for completed tasks | 7 |
| `COMPLETED_TASKS_HOURS` | Number of hours to look back for completed tasks | 24 |

## Installation

### Using Docker

Pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/echohello-dev/prometheus-todoist-exporter:latest
```

Run the exporter:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 -e TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your_api_token ghcr.io/echohello-dev/prometheus-todoist-exporter:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. Copy the example environment file and edit it with your API token:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Todoist API token
```

2. Then start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both the Todoist exporter and a Prometheus instance configured to scrape metrics from the exporter.

### Using Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests are provided in the `deploy/kubernetes` directory. These can be applied directly or deployed with Kustomize.

1. Create the namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace monitoring
   ```

2. Create a Secret with your Todoist API token:
   ```bash
   TODOIST_API_TOKEN_B64=$(echo -n 'your-todoist-api-token' | base64)
   sed "s/<BASE64_ENCODED_API_TOKEN>/$TODOIST_API_TOKEN_B64/" deploy/kubernetes/secret.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

   Or create the Secret manually:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic todoist-secret -n monitoring --from-literal=api-token=your-todoist-api-token
   ```

3. Deploy with Kustomize:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes
   ```

4. To access the metrics endpoint:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n monitoring service/prometheus-todoist-exporter 9090:9090
   ```

5. View the metrics at http://localhost:9090/metrics

### Using Helm

A Helm chart is available in the `deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter` directory.

1. Deploy the chart:
   ```bash
   helm install todoist-exporter ./deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter \
     --namespace monitoring --create-namespace \
     --set todoist.apiToken="your-todoist-api-token"
   ```

2. Configure with custom values:
   ```bash
   helm install todoist-exporter ./deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter \
     --namespace monitoring --create-namespace \
     --set todoist.apiToken="your-todoist-api-token" \
     --set exporter.collectionInterval=30 \
     --set service.type=NodePort
   ```

3. Using a custom values file:
   ```bash
   # Create a values.yaml file with your custom configuration
   cat > my-values.yaml << EOF
   todoist:
     apiToken: "your-todoist-api-token"
   exporter:
     collectionInterval: 30
   serviceMonitor:
     enabled: true
   EOF

   # Install with custom values
   helm install todoist-exporter ./deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter \
     --namespace monitoring --create-namespace \
     --values my-values.yaml
   ```

4. To upgrade the deployment:
   ```bash
   helm upgrade todoist-exporter ./deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter \
     --namespace monitoring \
     --reuse-values \
     --set exporter.completedTasksDays=14
   ```

5. To uninstall:
   ```bash
   helm uninstall todoist-exporter --namespace monitoring
   ```

### Using Poetry

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   poetry add prometheus-todoist-exporter
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Todoist API token
   ```

4. Run the exporter:
   ```bash
   source .env && poetry run todoist-exporter
   ```

## Local Development

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/echohello-dev/prometheus-todoist-exporter.git
   cd prometheus-todoist-exporter
   ```

2. Set up development environment:
   ```bash
   task setup-dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if it doesn't exist)
   - Install dependencies via Poetry
   - Install pre-commit hooks

3. Edit the `.env` file with your Todoist API token:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env with your preferred editor
   nano .env
   ```

4. Run the exporter:
   ```bash
   source .env && task run
   ```

### Using asdf for tool version management

This project uses [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage tool versions (Python, Poetry, Task).

1. Install asdf following the [installation instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/echohello-dev/prometheus-todoist-exporter.git
   cd prometheus-todoist-exporter
   ```

3. Install the required tools with asdf:
   ```bash
   task setup
   ```

   This will install the correct versions of Python, Poetry, and Task as specified in `.tool-versions`, and set up your development environment.

4. Run the exporter:
   ```bash
   source .env && task run
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   task test
   ```

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit to enforce code quality and standards. The hooks ensure that all code commits meet the project's requirements.

To install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
task pre-commit-install
```

To manually run the pre-commit checks:

```bash
task pre-commit-run
```

The following checks are included:
- Code formatting with Ruff
- Linting with Ruff
- Basic file checks (trailing whitespace, YAML validation, etc.)
- Poetry configuration verification
- Running tests

## Using Taskfile

This project includes a Taskfile for easy command orchestration. You need to have [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed, or you can use the version installed by asdf.

Available tasks:

```bash
# Set up local development environment (copy .env.example to .env and install deps)
task setup-dev

# Set up asdf with all required tools
task setup

# Install dependencies
task install

# Format the code with Ruff
task format

     docker-compose up -d
     ```

## Helm Chart Management

The project includes a Helm chart in the `deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter` directory. When making changes to the Helm chart, follow these guidelines:

### Chart Versioning

1. The Helm chart follows semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`)
2. Chart version is specified in `deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter/Chart.yaml`
3. When updating the chart:
   - For non-breaking changes, increment the patch version
   - For new features (non-breaking), increment the minor version
   - For breaking changes, increment the major version

### Testing Chart Changes

Before committing chart changes:

1. Lint the chart:
   ```bash
   task helm-lint
   ```

2. Test template rendering:
   ```bash
   task helm-template
   ```

3. Test installation in a dev environment:
   ```bash
   task helm-deploy
   ```

### Chart Documentation

Keep the chart documentation in `deploy/helm/prometheus-todoist-exporter/README.md` synchronized with any changes to:
- Chart parameters and defaults
- Required Kubernetes versions
- Examples

### Release Process

When a new version of the exporter is released, the chart's `appVersion` should be updated to match the released version.
