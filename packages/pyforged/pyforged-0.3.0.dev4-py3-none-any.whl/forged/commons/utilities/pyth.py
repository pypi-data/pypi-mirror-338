"""
This module provides utility functions for managing Python packages using the `pip` package manager and `importlib.metadata`.

Functions:
- `is_package_installed(package_name, version=None)`: Check if a particular package (optionally by version) is currently installed.
- `get_installed_packages()`: List all installed packages.
- `get_package_metadata(package_name)`: Retrieve metadata for a specific package.
- `is_version_compatible(package_name, version_spec)`: Check if the installed version of a package meets a specified version requirement.
- `list_package_dependencies(package_name)`: List all dependencies of a specific package.
- `get_outdated_packages()`: Get a list of outdated packages in the current environment.
- `install_package(package_name, version=None)`: Install a package using pip.
- `upgrade_package(package_name)`: Upgrade a package using pip.
- `get_package_paths(package_names)`: Get the installation path(s) for one or multiple packages.
- `uninstall_package(package_name)`: Uninstall a package using pip.
- `get_python_version()`: Get the current Python version.
- `is_package_up_to_date(package_name)`: Check if a package is up-to-date.
- `get_latest_package_version(package_name)`: Get the latest version of a package available on PyPI.
- `get_python_interpreter_path()`: Get the installation path of the current Python interpreter.
