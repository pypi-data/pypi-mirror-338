## Features

- TCP socket communication with Temas devices
- Distance and mean distance queries
- Azimuth and elevation positioning in coarse, fast, fine steps
- Device control commands like `move_home`, `shutdown`, `restart`
- System status queries: temperature, hostname, MAC address, etc.
- Simple object-oriented interface for quick integration
