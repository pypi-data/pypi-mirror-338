``PyEPO`` (PyTorch-based End-to-End Predict-then-Optimize Tool) is a Python-based, open-source software that supports modeling and solving predict-then-optimize problems with the linear objective function. The core capability of ``PyEPO`` is to build optimization models with [GurobiPy](https://www.gurobi.com/), [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/), or any other solvers and algorithms, then embed the optimization model into an artificial neural network for the end-to-end training. For this purpose, ``PyEPO`` implements various methods as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) autograd modules.
