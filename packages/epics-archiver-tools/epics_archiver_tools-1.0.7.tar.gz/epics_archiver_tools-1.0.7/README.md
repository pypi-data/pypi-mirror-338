## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Using pip
You can install this package through `pip`:
```bash
pip install epics-archiver-tools
```

### From source
If you want to install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrea-pollastro/epics-archiver-tools.git
cd archivertools
pip install -e .
```

## üì¶ Dependencies

This package requires:
- Python >= 3.10
- numpy >= 1.26.3
- pandas >= 2.1.4
- python-dateutil >= 2.8.2
- pytz >= 2023.3
- urllib3 >= 2.0.0
- tqdm >= 4.65.0

## üöÄ Getting Started

Interactions with the archiver are managed by the `ArchiverClient` class. Let's see some examples.

### üì• Single PV data downloading
To download the data of a given PV, refer to the `.download_data()` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from archivertools import ArchiverClient

# Initialize the client with your archiver server URL
archiver_client = ArchiverClient(archiver_url="http://your-archiver-server")

pv = archiver_client.download_data(
    pv_name='YOUR_PV_NAME',
    precision=100,  # this defines the precision of your signal in ms
    start=datetime(year=2023, month=4, day=25, hour=22),
    end=datetime(year=2023, month=4, day=25, hour=23),
    verbose=False,
)
```

The returned `PV` object contains:
```python
pv.name  # PV name (string)
pv.raw_data  # Raw data as pandas.DataFrame
pv.clean_data  # Cleaned data as pandas.DataFrame
pv.properties  # PV properties as pandas.DataFrame
pv.first_timestamp  # First timestamp as datetime
pv.last_timestamp  # Last timestamp as datetime
```

### üßÆ Data matching
For a given `list` of PVs, data can be matched according to their timestamps. The list must be a sequence of `str`.
PVs could have different archiving policies. In order to have a matching on the timestamps, they must follow the same 
archiving policy (this means that all the archiving policies of the listed PVs must be reduced to a common archiving 
policy). The parameter `precision` allows to select the precision of the individual PVs to allow the data matching.

Example:
```python
pv_list = ['PV_NAME_1', 'PV_NAME_2']
matched_data = archiver_client.match_data(
    pv_list=pv_list,
    precision=100,
    start=datetime(year=2023, month=4, day=25, hour=22),
    end=datetime(year=2023, month=4, day=25, hour=23),
)
```

## üîß Configuration

The `ArchiverClient` can be configured with:
- `archiver_url`: The URL of your EPICS archiver server (default: "http://localhost:17665")
- `check_connection`: Whether to verify the connection on initialization (default: True)

Example:
```python
# Initialize without connection check
client = ArchiverClient(archiver_url="http://your-server:17665", check_connection=False)

# Or initialize with connection check
client = ArchiverClient(archiver_url="http://your-server:17665", check_connection=True)
```
