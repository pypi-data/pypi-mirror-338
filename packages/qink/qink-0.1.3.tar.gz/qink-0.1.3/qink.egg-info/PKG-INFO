# Qink

Qink is a powerful distributed data processing framework designed for efficiently consuming and processing partitioned data streams.

## Features

- **Partition-based Processing** üìä: Handles partitioned data sources with exceptional efficiency, improving performance metrics.
- **Parallel Processing** ‚ö°: Processes multiple partitions simultaneously with configurable workers per partition.
- **State Management** üõ°Ô∏è: Maintains processing state with reliability, ensuring fault tolerance.
- **Checkpointing**: Saves state at regular intervals to ensure data durability.
- **Key-based Distribution**: Distributes keys to workers with consistent precision for optimized processing.

## Usage

```python
import logging
from datetime import timedelta
from qink.lib.qink import Qink
from qink.lib.qink_storage_provider import YourStorageProvider
from qink.lib.qink_source import YourDataSource

# Configure Qink
logger = logging.getLogger("qink")
storage_provider = YourStorageProvider()
workers_per_partition = 4  # Customize for optimal performance
checkpoint_interval = timedelta(minutes=5)

# Initialize and start Qink
qink = Qink(
    logger=logger,
    storage_provider=storage_provider,
    workers_per_partition=workers_per_partition,
    checkpoint_interval=checkpoint_interval
)

# Connect to your data source
qink.source(YourDataSource()).start()
```
