# Whereas unix.yaml is the minimal environment for PandaModelsBackend, this conda env spec is derived
#   from that used by the Donti lab to include rl2grid in the codestack.

name: rl2grid_pm
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - pytorch
  - tensorboard
  - wandb
  - gymnasium>=0.29.1
  - stable-baselines3>=2.3.2
  - scipy
  - pyjulia  # brings julia
  - pandapower=2
  - pytest-xdist  # optional, for testing
  - curl<8.10  # avoid segfault in Julia w/ curl v8.10 . recheck periodically
  - pip
  - pip:
    - pandamodelsbackend  # this repo. comment this, clone the repo, and `pip install -e .` to develop
    - grid2op
    - lightsim2grid  # optional
    - matpowercaseframes  # optional
  # - cxx-compiler  # optional if needed for further pip packages requiring compilation

# Notes:
# * defaults and pytorch channels removed as likely unneeded.
# * cpuonly removed b/c not a c-f pkg
# * py312 has been tested. others likely work
# * pytorch was pinned at 2.2.0 and scipy at 1.11.3 . reset if needed for repro, but generic better.
# * recent stable-baselines3 can accommodate gymnasium v1, so pins relaxed to mins. reset if needed for repro. etc.
