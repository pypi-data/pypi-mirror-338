        About
        -----
        
        This add-on enables Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing (AST) for `SENAITE LIMS`_ by
        allowing the user to add analyses to a sample that are specifically designed for
        the measurement of the susceptibility of microorganisms to antibiotics. These
        analyses can be added either by means of pre-defined AST Panels or by direct
        assignment of Antibiotics and Microorganisms through a matrix.
        
        `senaite.ast`_ also incorporates a default analysis for the identification of
        microorganisms present in a given sample. Once microorganisms are identified by
        means of this identification analysis, the system automatically populates the
        list of available AST Panels for selection with those that fit better with the
        identified microorganism(s).
        
        Resistance analyses are qualitative and the supported results are in accordance
        with the `new definitions of susceptibility testing categories by EUCAST 2019`_:
        
        - S: Susceptible, standard dosing regimen
        - I: Susceptible, increased exposure
        - R: Resistant
        
        Although user can configure AST Panels for the automatic addition of analyses
        for the capture of diameter of the zone of inhibition, the system does not
        automatically calculate the qualitative results based on the diameter of zone
        and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). However, system can infere
        the susceptibility testing category automatically based on pre-defined
        Breakpoints Tables, along with the diameter of the inhibitory zone or the MIC
        value.
        
        Once installed, this add-on allows the laboratory to:
        
        * Maintain microorganisms (via `senaite.microorganism`_)
        * Maintain antibiotics and antibiotic classes (via `senaite.abx`_)
        * Maintain pre-defined AST Panels
        * Maintain pre-defined Breakpoints Tables
        * Analysis for the identification of microorganisms
        * Assignment of pre-defined AST Panels to a sample
        * Sample-level customization of AST Panel
        * Selective reporting of resistance results
        * Support for and selective reporting of extrapolated antibiotics
