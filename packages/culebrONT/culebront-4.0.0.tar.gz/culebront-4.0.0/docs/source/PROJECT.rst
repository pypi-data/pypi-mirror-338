Useful notes
============

Before launching CulebrONT, you could basecall arbitrarily multiplexed libraries across several Minion or PacBio runs with sequencing quality control and gather the output files by genome for subsequent steps. For ONT, use `Dorado`  and optionally use https://github.com/vibaotram/baseDmux. If you are using PacBio check https://github.com/PacificBiosciences.
