HTTP music dashboard to control playback via playerctl and display lyrics.

## Description

Provides a [Sanic](https://pypi.org/project/sanic/) web application and helper class to manage playback via [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl).

The web application is hosted using Sanic, which provides endpoints to query player information
from playerctl via [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/) bindings.
Lyrics are fetched using [syncedlyrics](https://pypi.org/project/syncedlyrics/).

Player information is pushed to the client over a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

No external JavaScript libraries are requried.
