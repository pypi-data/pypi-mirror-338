## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install c4f
```

### From source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alaamer12/c4f.git
cd c4f
```

2. Install using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the command in your Git repository:

```bash
c4f
```

The tool will:
1. Detect staged and unstaged changes in your repository
2. Analyze the changes and their context
3. Generate an appropriate commit message using AI
4. Stage and commit the changes with the generated message

### Command-line Options

```
usage: c4f [-h] [-v] [-r PATH] [-m MODEL] [-a NUM] [-t SEC] [-f]

Intelligent Git Commit Message Generator

options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit
  -r PATH, --root PATH  Set the root directory for git operations [default: current project root]
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Set the AI model to use for commit message generation [default: gpt-4-mini]
                        Choices: gpt-4-mini, gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo

Generation Options:
  Configure the commit message generation process

  -a NUM, --attempts NUM
                        Set the number of generation attempts before falling back [default: 3]
                        Range: 1-10
  -t SEC, --timeout SEC
                        Set the fallback timeout in seconds for model response [default: 10]
                        Range: 1-60

Formatting Options:
  Configure the commit message format

  -f, --force-brackets  Force conventional commit type with brackets (e.g., feat(scope): message)
```

### Examples

Generate commit messages with the default settings:
```bash
c4f
```

Use a specific AI model:
```bash
c4f --model gpt-4
```

Set custom generation parameters:
```bash
c4f --attempts 5 --timeout 20
```

Force brackets in conventional commit format:
```bash
c4f --force-brackets
```

Specify a different root directory:
```bash
c4f --root /path/to/your/repo
```

### Features in Detail

- **Smart Change Analysis**: Automatically detects the type of changes (feature, fix, documentation, etc.) based on file paths and content
- **Comprehensive Messages**: Generates detailed commit messages for larger changes with bullet points and breaking change notifications
- **Interactive Interface**: Displays changes in a formatted table and allows user interaction when needed
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress for file analysis and commit operations
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Includes a fallback system if AI generation fails or times out

## Configuration

Key configuration options available through command-line arguments:

| Option             | Description                           | Default    |

| `--model`          | AI model to use                       | gpt-4-mini |
| `--attempts`       | Number of message generation attempts | 3          |
| `--timeout`        | Timeout in seconds for AI response    | 10         |
| `--force-brackets` | Force brackets in conventional format | False      |

git clone https://github.com/alaamer12/c4f.git
cd c4f

# Install development dependencies
poetry install --with dev

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Model Compatibility 

While c4f has been primarily tested with `gpt-4-mini`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo`, the underlying g4f library supports many additional models. However, please note:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Although most g4f-supported models may technically work with c4f, they have not been extensively tested and are not officially recommended. Using untested models may result in:
- Lower quality commit messages
- Slower performance
- Unexpected errors or timeouts

For the best experience, we recommend using one of the officially supported models specified in the command-line options.
