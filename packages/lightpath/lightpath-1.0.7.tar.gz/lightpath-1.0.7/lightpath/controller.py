"""
While the :class:`.BeamPath` object provides basic control functionality, the
:class:`.LightController` is what organizes of all of LCLS's
devices. The facility is represented by an Directed Graph, starting at the
source and ending at the beamline hutches.  After placing each device in the
facility graph, each beamline is constructed as a :class:`.BeamPath` object.

This includes not only devices on the upstream beamline but all of the
beamlines before it. For example, the MEC beampath will include devices in both
the FEE and the XRT.  The MEC beampath will also contain devices that appear in
XPP's and XCS's beampath. In some cases there are multiple possible paths beam
may take to reach a given endstation.  In the case of multiple possible paths,
the :meth:`.LightController.active_path` will return the path with the latest
impediment.  (equivalently, the path that lets the beam through farthest)

The :class:`.LightController` handles this logic as well as a basic overview of
where the beam is
