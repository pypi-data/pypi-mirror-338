LCLS Lightpath
==============
.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/pcdshub/lightpath.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/pcdshub/lightpath

Python module for control of LCLS beamlines

By abstracting individual devices into larger collections of paths, operators
can quickly guide beam to experimental end stations. Instead of dealing with
the individual interfaces for each device, devices are summarized in states.
This allows operators to quickly view and manipulate large sections of the
beamline when the goal is to simply handle beam delivery.
