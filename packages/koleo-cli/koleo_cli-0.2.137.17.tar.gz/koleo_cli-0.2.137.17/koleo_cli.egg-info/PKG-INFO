# Koleo CLI

[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/koleo-cli.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/koleo-cli)

## Installation
**install via pip by running** `pip install koleo-cli`


![gif showcasing the functionality](https://github.com/lzgirlcat/koleo-cli/blob/main/koleo-cli.gif?raw=true)

## it currently allows you to:
 - get departures/arrival list for a station
 - get train info given its number and name(pull requests are welcome if you know how to get a train object by just the number)
 - find a station or list all known stations
 - find a connection from station a to b, with filtering by operators
 - save a station as your favourite to quickly check it's departures

additionally you can also use the KoleoAPI wrapper directly in your own projects, all returns are fully typed using `typing.TypedDict`

## MY(possibly controversial) design choices:
 - platforms and track numbers are shown using arabic numerals instead of roman
   - you can change it by adding `use_roman_numerals: true` to your config.json file
 - most api queries are cached for 24h
   - you can change it by adding `disable_cache: true` to your config.json file
 - the cli.py code is really dirty but printing formatted data is hard :<

pull requests are welcome!!
