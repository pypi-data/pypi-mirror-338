    As described in [1]_, the structural similarity index (SSIM) is a
    perceptual distance metric, giving the distance between two images. SSIM is
    based on three comparison measurements between the two images: luminance,
    contrast, and structure. All of these are computed convolutionally across the

    as well as providing the option to use the weighted version used in [4]_
    (which was shown to consistently improve the image quality prediction on
    the LIVE database).

    Note that this is a similarity metric (not a distance), and so 1 means the
    two images are identical and 0 means they're very different. When the two
    images are negatively correlated, SSIM can be negative. SSIM is bounded
    between -1 and 1.

    This function returns the mean SSIM, a scalar-valued metric giving the
    average over the whole image. For the SSIM map (showing the computed value
    across the image), call `ssim_map`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img1: torch.Tensor of shape (batch, channel, height, width)
        The first image or batch of images.

    weighted : bool, optional
        whether to use the original, unweighted SSIM version (`False`) as used
        in [1]_ or the weighted version (`True`) as used in [4]_. See Notes

        If not False, how to pad the image for the convolutions computing the

    -------
    mssim : torch.Tensor
        2d tensor of shape (batch, channel) containing the mean SSIM for each
        image, averaged over the whole image

    Notes
    -----
    The weight used when `weighted=True` is:

    r"""Multiscale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM)

    As described in [1]_, multiscale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) is
    an improvement upon structural similarity index (SSIM) that takes into
    account the perceptual distance between two images on different scales.

    SSIM is based on three comparison measurements between the two images:
    luminance, contrast, and structure. All of these are computed convolutionally
    across the images, producing three maps instead of scalars. The SSIM map is
    the elementwise product of these three maps. See `metric.ssim` and
    `metric.ssim_map` for a full description of SSIM.

    To get images of different scales, average pooling operations with kernel
    size 2 are performed recursively on the input images. The product of
    contrast map and structure map (the "contrast-structure map") is computed
    for all but the coarsest scales, and the overall SSIM map is only computed
    for the coarsest scale. Their mean values are raised to exponents and
    multiplied to produce MS-SSIM:

    .. math::
        MSSSIM = {SSIM}_M^{a_M} \prod_{i=1}^{M-1} ({CS}_i)^{a_i}

    Here :math: `M` is the number of scales, :math: `{CS}_i` is the mean value
    of the contrast-structure map for the i'th finest scale, and :math: `{SSIM}_M`
    is the mean value of the SSIM map for the coarsest scale. If at least one
    of these terms are negative, the value of MS-SSIM is zero. The values of
    :math: `a_i, i=1,...,M` are taken from the argument `power_factors`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img1: torch.Tensor of shape (batch, channel, height, width)
        The first image or batch of images.
    img2: torch.Tensor of shape (batch, channel, height, width)
        The second image or batch of images. The heights and widths of `img1`
        and `img2` must be the same. The numbers of batches and channels of
        `img1` and `img2` need to be broadcastable: either they are the same
        or one of them is 1. The output will be computed separately for each
        channel (so channels are treated in the same way as batches). Both
        images should have values between 0 and 1. Otherwise, the result may
        be inaccurate, and we will raise a warning (but will still compute it).
    power_factors : 1D array, optional.
        power exponents for the mean values of maps, for different scales (from
        fine to coarse). The length of this array determines the number of scales.
        By default, this is set to [0.0448, 0.2856, 0.3001, 0.2363, 0.1333],
        which is what psychophysical experiments in [1]_ found.

    As described in  [1]_, this is an image quality metric based on the transformations
    associated with the early visual system: local luminance subtraction and local

    A laplacian pyramid subtracts a local estimate of the mean luminance at six scales.
    Then a local gain control divides these centered coefficients by a weighted sum of
    absolute values in spatial neighborhood.

    These weights parameters were optimized for redundancy reduction over an training
    database of (undistorted) natural images, as described in the paper. Parameters were
    copied from matlab code used for the paper, found at  [2]_.

    Note that we compute root mean squared error for each scale, and then average over

    (which are fewer in number, due to subsampling).
