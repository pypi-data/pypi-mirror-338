class LaplacianPyramid(nn.Module):
    """Laplacian Pyramid in Torch.

    The Laplacian pyramid [1]_ is a multiscale image representation. It
    decomposes the image by computing the local mean using Gaussian blurring
    filters and substracting it from the image and repeating this operation on
    the local mean itself after downsampling. This representation is
    overcomplete and invertible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_scales: int
        number of scales to compute
    scale_filter: bool, optional
        If true, the norm of the downsampling/upsampling filter is 1. If false
        (default), it is 2.
        If the norm is 1, the image is multiplied by 4 during the upsampling operation;
        the net effect is that the `n`th scale of the pyramid is divided by `2^n`.
