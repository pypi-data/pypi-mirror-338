# PyAutoPilot

## Overview
"PyAutoPilot" is an intelligent Python module that automatically detects missing dependencies in your script and installs them. It scans your script for "import" statements, checks for missing packages, and installs them using "pip"â€”making dependency management seamless.

## Features
- ðŸš€ **Automatic Dependency Detection** â€“ Scans your script for required imports.
- ðŸ”§ **Auto-Installation** â€“ Installs missing dependencies using "pip".
- âœ… **Smart Mapping** â€“ Handles cases where module names differ from package names (e.g., "win32com.client" â†’ "pywin32").
- ðŸ”„ **Hassle-Free Execution** â€“ No manual intervention needed; just import "PyAutoPilot", and it works.
