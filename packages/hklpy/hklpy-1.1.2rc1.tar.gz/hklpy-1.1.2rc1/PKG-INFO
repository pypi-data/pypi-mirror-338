Controls for using diffractometers within the [Bluesky
Framework](https://blueskyproject.io).

Based on the *hkl*  C library (described here as [*libhkl*](https://people.debian.org/~picca/hkl/hkl.html#)), with
slightly cleaner abstractions when compared to the auto-generated
`gobject-introspection` classes. Integrates with ophyd
pseudopositioners.
