# LeanInteract

**LeanInteract** is a Python package designed to seamlessly interact with Lean 4 through the [Lean REPL](https://github.com/leanprover-community/repl).

## Key Features

- **üîó Interactivity**: Execute Lean code and files directly from Python.
- **üöÄ Ease of Use**: LeanInteract abstracts the complexities of Lean setup and interaction.
- **üîß Compatibility**: Supports all Lean versions between `v4.7.0-rc1` and `v4.19.0-rc2`.
- **üì¶ Temporary Projects**: Easily instantiate temporary Lean environments.
  - Useful for experimenting with benchmarks depending on [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) like [ProofNet#](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PAug/ProofNetSharp) and [MiniF2F](https://github.com/yangky11/miniF2F-lean4).

## Installation and Setup

You can install the LeanInteract package using the following command:

```bash
pip install lean-interact
```

Requirements:

- Python >= 3.10
- git
- [Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) (or use the `install-lean` command from LeanInteract)

> [!NOTE]
> This tool is still experimental and has been primarily tested on Linux. Compatibility with macOS is not guaranteed. For Windows, use WSL.
> Please report any issues you encounter.

## Script examples

In the `examples` directory, you will find a few scripts demonstrating how to use LeanInteract.

- `proof_generation_and_autoformalization.py`: use [DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08152), [Goedel-Prover](https://goedel-lm.github.io/), and other models on [MiniF2F](https://github.com/yangky11/miniF2F-lean4) and [ProofNet#](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PAug/ProofNetSharp) benchmarks.
- `beq_plus.py`: run the autoformalization [BEq+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07222) metric on the [ProofNetVerif](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PAug/ProofNetVerif) benchmark.
- `type_check.py`: optimize type checking using environment states.
- `statement_autoformalization_sampling.py`: sampling-based method used in [Improving Autoformalization using Type Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07222).

## Usage

### Default Lean version (latest available)

```python
from lean_interact import LeanREPLConfig, LeanServer, Command

config = LeanREPLConfig(verbose=True) # download and build Lean REPL
server = LeanServer(config) # start Lean REPL
server.run(Command(cmd="theorem ex (n : Nat) : n = 5 ‚Üí n = 5 := id"))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
CommandResponse(env=0)
```

</details>

Iterate on the environment state:

```python
server.run(Command(cmd="example (x : Nat) : x = 5 ‚Üí x = 5 := by exact ex x", env=0))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
CommandResponse(env=1)
```

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> The initial invocation of `LeanREPLConfig` might take some time as it downloads and builds Lean REPL. Future executions with identical parameters will be significantly quicker due to caching.

### Specific Lean version

```python
config = LeanREPLConfig(lean_version="v4.7.0")
```

### Existing Lean projects

```python
config = LeanREPLConfig(project=LocalProject("path/to/your/project"))
```

or

```python
config = LeanREPLConfig(project=GitProject("https://github.com/yangky11/lean4-example"))
```

You can then use `run` as usual:

```python
from lean_interact import FileCommand

server = LeanServer(config)
server.run(FileCommand(path="file.lean"))
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the project can be *successfully* built with `lake build` before using LeanInteract.

### Temporary project with dependencies

```python
from lean_interact import TempRequireProject

config = LeanREPLConfig(lean_version="v4.7.0", project=TempRequireProject([LeanRequire(
    name="mathlib",
    git="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git",
    rev="v4.7.0"
)]))
```

Mathlib being a frequent requirement, a shortcut is available:

```python
config = LeanREPLConfig(lean_version="v4.7.0", project=TempRequireProject("mathlib"))
```

You can then use Mathlib as follows:

```python
server = LeanServer(config)
server.run(Command(cmd="""import Mathlib
theorem ex_mathlib (x : ‚Ñù) (y : ‚Ñö) :
  ( Irrational x ) -> Irrational ( x + y ) := sorry"""))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
CommandResponse(
  messages=[
    Message(
      start_pos=Pos(line=2, column=8),
      end_pos=Pos(line=2, column=18),
      data="declaration uses 'sorry'",
      severity='warning'
  )],
  sorries=[
    Sorry(
      start_pos=Pos(line=3, column=46),
      end_pos=Pos(line=3, column=51),
      goal='x : ‚Ñù\ny : ‚Ñö\n‚ä¢ Irrational x ‚Üí Irrational (x + ‚Üëy)',
      proof_state=0
  )],
  env=0
)
```

</details>

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Mathlib is a large library and may take some time to download and build.
> - A separate cache is used for each unique set of dependencies.

### Fine-grained temporary project

For more control over the temporary project, you can use `TemporaryProject` to specify the content of the lakefile.

```python
from lean_interact import TemporaryProject

config = LeanREPLConfig(lean_version="v4.18.0", project=TemporaryProject("""
import Lake
open Lake DSL

package "dummy" where
  version := v!"0.1.0"

@[default_target]
lean_exe "dummy" where
  root := `Main

require mathlib from git
  "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git" @ "v4.18.0"
"""))
```

### Tactic mode (experimental)

```python
server.run(Command(cmd="theorem ex (n : Nat) : n = 5 ‚Üí n = 5 := sorry"))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
CommandResponse(
  messages=[
    Message(
      start_pos=Pos(line=1, column=8),
      end_pos=Pos(line=1, column=10),
      data="declaration uses 'sorry'",
      severity='warning'
  )],
  sorries=[
    Sorry(
      start_pos=Pos(line=1, column=40),
      end_pos=Pos(line=1, column=45),
      goal='n : Nat\n‚ä¢ n = 5 ‚Üí n = 5',
      proof_state=0
  )],
  env=0
)
```

</details>

You can then iterate on the proof state by executing tactics:

```python
server.run(ProofStep(tactic="intro h", proof_state=0))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
ProofStepResponse(goals=['n : Nat\nh : n = 5\n‚ä¢ n = 5'], proof_state=1)
```

</details>

```python
server.run(ProofStep(tactic="exact h", proof_state=1))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
ProofStepResponse(goals=[], proof_state=2)
```

</details>

or by directly running the entire proof:

```python
server.run(ProofStep(tactic="(\nintro h\nexact h)", proof_state=0))
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```python
ProofStepResponse(goals=[], proof_state=3)
```

</details>

## Helper Commands

The following commands are installed with LeanInteract:

- `install-lean`: Installs Lean 4 version manager `elan`.
- `clear-lean-cache`: Removes all Lean REPL versions and temporary projects in the package cache. This can help resolve some issues. If it does, please open an issue.

## Advanced options

### LeanServer

Two versions of Lean servers are available:

- **`LeanServer`**: A wrapper around Lean REPL. Interact with it using the `run` method.
- **`AutoLeanServer`**: An experimental subclass of `LeanServer` automatically recovering from some crashes and timeouts. It also monitors memory usage to limit *out of memory* issues in multiprocessing contexts. Use the `add_to_session_cache` attribute available in the `run` method to prevent selected environment/proof states to be cleared.

> [!TIP]
>
> - To run multiple requests in parallel, we recommend using multiprocessing with one global `LeanREPLConfig` instance, and one `AutoLeanServer` instance per process.
> - Make sure to instantiate `LeanREPLConfig` before starting the processes to avoid conflicts during Lean REPL's download and build.
> - While `AutoLeanServer` can help prevent crashes, it is not a complete solution. If you encounter crashes, consider reducing the number of parallel processes or increasing the memory available to your system.

### Custom Lean REPL

To use a forked Lean REPL project, specify the git repository using the `repl_git` parameter in the `LeanREPLConfig`. Your fork should have a similar versioning format to <https://github.com/augustepoiroux/repl> (i.e. having a branch with commits for each Lean version).
