magpack
=======
magpack provides a set of tools for analyzing simulations and reconstructions of 3D vector and orientation fields.

Installation
------------
magpack can be installed through pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv)$ pip install magpack

Examples
--------
magpack contains tools for:

- loading and saving data in formats such as ``.mat``, ``.ovf`` and ``.vtk``.
- performing vector operations
- calculating and evaluating scalar and vector field rotations
- removing image distortions, coloring complex arrays (e.g. Fourier transforms) and evaluating image resolutions using
  Fourier shell correlation

Documentation
-------------
Comprehensive documentation is available online at `readthedocs <https://magpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
