class AffTree:
    """
    A class used to represent pice-wise linear functions (i.e., piecewise linear neural networks) in the form of a
    decision tree.

    Each AffTree represents a piecewise linear function g : R^m -> R^n, where m is called the input dimension and n is called
    the output dimension.

    Nodes in this Tree are of type AffNode.

    Non-terminal nodes in this tree represent the boundaries of the different regions, terminal nodes represent the linear function
    of a given linear region.

    While the primary function of AffTrees is to represent neural networks in a white-box fashion, they can efficiently handle any
    piecewise linear function, even those that are not continuous.

    NOTE:
        Vectors are represented as numpy arrays with one axis
        Matrices are represented as numpy arrays with two axes

    Constructors
    -----------
    identity(dim_in:int) -> AffTree
        Constructs an AffTree that represents the identity function id: R^{dim_in} -> R^{dim_in} with id(x)=x.

    from_array(weights:npt.NDArray (Matrix), bias: npt.NDArray (Vector))
        Constructs an AffTree that represents the function f(x)=weights*x+bias.

    Methods
    -----------
    apply_function(aff_func: AffFunc)
        Applies aff_func to the AffTree. If a tree represented the function g, it represents the function f(x) = aff_func(g(x)) after execution-

    compose(other:AffTree)
        Composes two AffTrees. If self represented the function g and other represents the function f, self represents f(g(x)) after execution.

    evaluate(npt.NDArray (Vector))->npt.NDArray (Vector)
        Evaluates the tree on a given input vector

    infeasible_elimination(precondition: Optional[Polytope])
        Removes all paths from the AffTree that cannot be reached by any input that satisfies the precondition. If no precondition
        is specified, all inputs are considered.

    size()-> int
        Returns the total number of nodes in the tree.

    num_leaves() -> int
        Returns the number of leaf nodes in the tree.

    parent(node:AffNode)->AffNode
        Returns the parent node of node

    child(node:AffNode, label:int)-> AffNode
        Returns the child node that is reached from the input node if (label=1) the condition of node is satisfied or (label=0) unsatisfied.

    nodes() -> list[AffNodes]
        Returns a list of all nodes in the tree.

    terminals() -> list[AffNodes]
        Returns a list of all terminal nodes in the tree.

    dfs() -> List[Tuple[int, 'AffNode']]
        Returns the nodes of the tree, numbered by a depth-first search

    edges() -> List[Tuple[AffNode, int, AffNode]]
        Returns the edges of the tree. Each tuple is of the form (source, label,target)

    polyhedra() -> List[Tuple[int, 'AffNode', 'Polytope']]
        Returns the linear regions of the AffTree. Each tuple is of the form (num, Terminal, Polytope). The Polytope
        characterizes the linear region and Terminal contains the AffineFunction that is associated with that linear region.

        func : AffFunc

        """
        Composes the current tree with other.
        
        After execution the current tree represents the function f(g(x)) where g
        is the function represented by the current tree and f is the function represented by other.
        This is the opposite order of (mathematical) function composition as, e.g., used by AffFunc.compose.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        other : AffTree
            A tree representing a function f to be composed with the function g represented by the current tree.
        prune : bool (default: True) 
            Enable on-the-fly optimization during composition (recommended), see also infeasible_elimination.

        Assumptions
        -----------
        Dimensions must match: Specifially, the output dimension of self must be equal to the input dimension of other.
        
        Notes
        -----
        After composition, the current tree has out dimension equal to the out dimension of other.

        In the worst case, the size of the resulting tree can be proportional to the product of the original tree sizes.
        When composing two large trees, this can lead to long runtimes and large models. 
        To mitigate this one can either optimize the trees beforehand by calling infeasible_elimination or one can enable on-the-fly optimization for compose.
        """

    def infeasible_elimination():
        """
        Removes all infeasible paths from the tree. 
        
        A path is called infeasible iff there exists no input that would ever
        traverse that path (for example, the path [x_1 <0, x_1 >0] is always infeasible). After execution, every edge in the
        tree can at least in principle be traversed by some input. In many cases, this drastically reduces the number of
        nodes and edges in the tree, saving resources.

        Notes
        -----
        Infeasible elimination does NOT change the semantics of the tree,
        but can drastically reduce its size.

        If infeasible elimination is not used, AffTrees can blow up very quickly. Therefore: Use early and often.

        This method optimizes the structure of the AffTree by identifying and merging terminals that represent
        equivalent affine functions.
